Equifax collects and aggregates information on over 800 million individual consumers and more than 88 million businesses worldwide. Founded in 1899 and based in Atlanta\n, Georgia\n, it is one of the three largest credit agencies along with Experian\nand TransUnion\n(known as the “Big Three”).[4]\n\nEquifax has US$3.1 billion in annual revenue and 9,000+[3]\n\nemployees in 14 countries. It is listed on the NYSE\nas EFX.","Aside from offering credit and demographic related data and services to business,[5]\n\nEquifax sells credit monitoring and fraud-prevention services directly to consumers.[6]\n\nLike all credit reporting agencies, the company is required by US law to provide consumers with one free credit report every year.[7]\n\n","Equifax was the subject of more than 57,000 consumer complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\nfrom October 2012 to September 17, 2017 with most complaints relating to incomplete, inaccurate, outdated, or misattributed information held by the company.[8]\n\n","In September 2017, Equifax announced a cyber-security breach\n, which it claims to have occurred between mid-May and July 2017,[9]\n\nwhere cybercriminals accessed approximately 145.5 million U.S. Equifax consumers' personal data, including their full names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and, in some cases, driver license numbers. Equifax also confirmed at least 209,000 consumers' credit card credentials were taken in the attack. The company claims to have discovered evidence of the cybercrime event on July 29, 2017. Residents in the United Kingdom\nand Canada\nwere also impacted.","","","Equifax was founded in Atlanta, GA, as Retail Credit Company in 1899. The company grew quickly and by 1920 had offices throughout the US and Canada. By the 1960s, Retail Credit Company was one of the nation's largest credit bureaus, holding files on millions of American and Canadian citizens. Even though the company continued to do credit reporting, the majority of their business was making reports to insurance companies when people applied for new insurance policies including life, auto, fire and medical insurance. All of the major insurance companies used RCC to get information on health, habits, morals, use of vehicles and finances. They also investigated insurance claims and made employment reports when people were seeking new jobs. Most of the credit work was then being done by a subsidiary, Retailers Commercial Agency.","Retail Credit Company's extensive information holdings, and its willingness to sell them to anyone, attracted criticism of the company in the 1960s and 1970s. These included that it collected \"...facts, statistics, inaccuracies and rumors… about virtually every phase of a person's life; his marital troubles, jobs, school history, childhood, sex life, and political activities.\" The company was also alleged to reward its employees for collecting negative information on consumers.[10]\n\n","As a result, when the company moved to computerize its records, which would lead to much wider availability of the personal information it held, the US Congress held hearings in 1970. These led to the enactment of the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nin the same year which gave consumers rights regarding information stored about them in corporate databanks. It is alleged that the hearings prompted the Retail Credit Company to change its name to Equifax in 1975 to improve its image.[10]\n\n","The company later expanded into commercial credit reports on companies in the US, Canada and the UK, where it came into competition with companies such as Dun \u0026amp; Bradstreet\nand Experian\n. The insurance reporting was phased out. The company also had a division selling specialist credit information to the insurance industry but spun off this service, including the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE) database as ChoicePoint\nin 1997. The company formerly offered digital certification services, which it sold to GeoTrust\nin September 2001. In the same year, Equifax spun off its payment services division, forming the publicly listed company Certegy\n, which subsequently acquired Fidelity National Information Services\nin 2006. Certegy effectively became a subsidiary of Fidelity National Financial\nas a result of this reverse acquisition merger (See Certegy\nand Fidelity National Information Services\nfor further information)\n.","In October 2010, Equifax acquired Anakam, an identity verification software company.[11]\n\n","Equifax purchased eThority\n, a business intelligence\n(BI) company headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina\nin October 2011. eThority is partnering with TALX\n, a St. Louis-based business unit of Equifax, and will remain in Charleston.[12]\n\n","Equifax Workforce Solutions is one of the 55 contractors hired by the United States Department of Health and Human Services\nto work on the HealthCare.gov\nweb site.[13]\n\n","For most of its existence, Equifax has operated primarily in the business-to-business sector, selling consumer credit and insurance reports and related analytics to businesses in a range of industries.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nBusiness customers include retailers\n, insurance\nfirms, healthcare providers, utilities, government agencies, as well as banks\n, credit unions, personal and specialty finance companies and other financial institutions. Equifax sells businesses credit reports, analytics, demographic\ndata, and software. Credit reports provide detailed information on the personal credit and payment history of individuals, indicating how they have honored financial obligations such as paying bills or repaying a loan\n. Credit grantors use this information to decide what sort of products or services to offer their customers, and on what terms. Equifax also provides commercial credit reports, similar to Dun \u0026amp; Bradstreet, containing financial and non financial data on businesses of all sizes. Equifax collects and provides data through the NCTUE, an exchange of non credit data including consumer payment history on telco and utility accounts.","In 1999, Equifax began offering services to the credit consumer sector in addition, such as credit fraud and identity theft prevention products. Equifax, and other credit monitoring agencies are required by law to provide US residents with one free credit file disclosure every 12 months; the Annualcreditreport.com\nwebsite incorporates data from US Equifax credit records.","Equifax also offers fraud prevention products based on device fingerprinting\nsuch as \"FraudIQ Authenticate Device\".[14]\n\n","According to an October 2017 report from Motherboard\n, around December 2016, a security researcher examining Equifax's servers observed an online portal, apparently created for Equifax employees only, was accessible to the open Internet.","\"I didn't have to do anything fancy,\" the researcher told Motherboard, explaining that the site was vulnerable to a basic \"forced browsing\" bug. The researcher requested anonymity out of professional concerns. \"\"All you had to do was put in a search term and get millions of results, just instantly—in cleartext, through a web app,\" they said. In total, the researcher downloaded the data of hundreds of thousands of Americans in order to show Equifax the vulnerabilities within its systems. They said they could have downloaded the data of all of Equifax's customers in 10 minutes: \"I've seen a lot of bad things, but not this bad.\"","The same types of sensitive private information of American consumers (names, birth dates, social security numbers, etc.) were exposed as in the May–July breach, according to Motherboard. Additionally, the security researchers said they were able to gain shell\naccess on Equifax's servers and discovered and reported to Equifax additional vulnerabilities. According to the reporting, despite receiving this warning from the security researcher, the affected portal was not closed until six months later in June, well after the March and May–July breaches had begun.[15]\n\nMoreover, the employee portal was reportedly not the same server targeted in the later breaches, which Motherboard speculates may suggest multiple breaches by more than one party may have occurred.","On September 18, 2017, Bloomberg News\nreported that Equifax had been the victim of a \"major breach of its computer systems\" in March 2017, and that in early March it had begun \"notifying a small number of outsiders and banking customers\" about this attack.[16]\n\n","According to Bloomberg's report, a person familiar with the breach believed this early-March intrusion may have been carried out by the same party who breached Equifax's computer systems again in May. According to Bloomberg, Equifax enlisted Mandiant\n(owned by FireEye, Inc.\n) to assist in investigating the March attack. The same cybersecurity firm was hired following the May–July breach.[16]\n\n","On September 7, 2017, Equifax announced a cybercrime identity theft event potentially impacting approximately 145.5 million U.S. consumers.[18]\n\nInformation on an estimated range of under 400,000 up to 44 million British residents as well as 8,000 Canadian residents were also compromised.[19]\n\n[20]\n\n[21]\n\n[22]\n\n[23]\n\nVentureBeat\n\ncalled the exposure of data on 140 million customers \"one of the biggest data breaches in history.\"[24]\n\n","Though the attack was stated to have begun in mid-May, the breach was not observed until July 29, according to Equifax CEO Rick Smith and a subsequent report by Equifax.[9]\n\n[18]\n\n[25]\n\nInformation accessed by the hacker (or hackers) in the breach included first and last names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers. Credit card numbers for approximately 209,000 U.S. consumers, and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers were also accessed.[26]\n\n[25]\n\n","Equifax stated in a September 15 statement that it hired the services of Mandiant\non August 2 to internally investigate the intrusion. The statement did not however record in its timeline exactly when government authorities (\"all U.S. State Attorneys General\" and \"other federal regulators\") were notified of the breach, although it did assert \"the company continues to work closely with the FBI in its investigation.\"[25]\n\n","Equifax shares dropped 13 percent in early trading the day after the breach was made public.[27]\n\n","Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Equifax as a result of the breach.[28]\n\n[29]\n\nIn one suit the law firm Geragos \u0026amp; Geragos has indicated they would seek up to $70 billion in damages, which would make it the largest class-action suit in U.S. history.[28]\n\n","Numerous media outlets advised consumers to request a credit freeze\nto reduce the impact of the breach.[30]\n\n[31]\n\n[32]\n\n[33]\n\n","Equifax said the breach was facilitated using a flaw in Apache Struts\n(CVE-2017-5638).[34]\n\nA patch\nfor the vulnerability was released March 7, yet the company failed to apply the security updates before the attack occurred 2 months later.[35]\n\n[36]\n\nHowever, this was not the only point of failure: contributing factors included the insecure network design which lacked sufficient segmentation,[37]\n\npotentially inadequate encryption\nof personally identifiable information (PII),[38]\n\nand ineffective breach detection mechanisms\n.[39]\n\n","On September 15, Equifax issued a press release with bullet-point details of the intrusion, its potential consequences for consumers, and the company's response. The statement further commented on issues related to criticism regarding its initial response to the incident. The company also announced the immediate departures and replacements of its Chief Information Officer and Chief Security Officer.[25]\n\n[40]\n\n","Three days after Equifax revealed the May–July 2017 breach, Congressman Barry Loudermilk\n(R-GA), who had been given thousands of dollars by Equifax,[41]\n\n[42]\n\nintroduced a bill to the US House\nthat would reduce consumer protections in relation to the nation’s credit bureaus, including capping potential damages in a class action\nsuit to $500,000 regardless of class size or amount of loss.[43]\n\nThe bill would also eliminate all punitive damages\n.[43]\n\n[44]\n\nFollowing criticism by consumer advocates, Loudermilk agreed to delay consideration of the bill \"pending a full and complete investigation into the Equifax breach.\"[43]\n\n","On September 28, 2017, new Equifax CEO Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. responded to criticism of Equifax by promising that the company would, from early 2018, allow \"all consumers the option of controlling access to their personal credit data,\" and that this service would be \"offered free, for life.\"[45]\n\n","On October 2, 2017, Equifax revealed that the estimated number of affected Americans was 2.5 million more than previously reported. This brought the total number of potentially impacted Americans to 145.5 million.[46]\n\n","On October 10, 2017, Equifax stated that 15.2m UK customers had their records compromised in the breach,[47]\n\n[48]\n\nof which 693,665 had sensitive personal data\ndisclosed.[49]\n\n[50]\n\n[47]\n\n[51]\n\n[48]\n\n","Also around October 10, 2017, the number of drivers' licenses breached in the attack was reported to be 10-11million.[52]\n\n[53]\n\n[54]\n\n","In September, 2017, Richard Cordray\n, then director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n(CFPB), authorized an investigation into the data breach on behalf of affected consumers. However, in November, 2017, Mick Mulvaney\n, President Donald Trump’s budget chief, who was appointed by Trump to replace Cordray, was reported by Reuters to have “pulled back” on the probe, along with shelving Cordray’s plans for on-the-ground tests of how Equifax protects data. The CFPB also rebuffed bank regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank\n, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nand Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\nwho offered to assist with on-site exams of credit bureaus.[55]\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren\n, who released a report February 7, 2018 on the Equifax breech, was critical of Mulvaney’s actions, saying ““We’re unveiling this report while Mick Mulvaney is killing the consumer agency’s probe into the Equifax breach. Mick Mulvaney shoots another middle finger at consumers.”[56]\n\n","Following the announcement of the May–July 2017 breach, Equifax's actions received widespread criticism. Equifax did not immediately disclose whether PINs\nand other sensitive information were compromised, nor did it explain the delay between its discovery of the breach in July and its public announcement in early September.[57]\n\nEquifax stated that the delay was due to the time needed to determine the scope of the intrusion and the large amount of personal data involved.[58]\n\n","It was also revealed that three Equifax executives sold almost $1.8 million of their personal holdings of company shares days after Equifax discovered the breach but more than a month before the breach was made public.[59]\n\nThe company said the executives, including the chief financial officer John Gamble,[60]\n\n[27]\n\n\"had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred at the time they sold their shares\".[61]\n\nOn September 18, Bloomberg\nreported that the US Justice Department\nhad opened an investigation to determine whether or not insider trading laws had been violated.[62]\n\n","When publicly revealing the intrusion to its systems, Equifax offered a website (https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com[63]\n\n) for consumers to learn whether they were victims of the breach. Security experts quickly noted that the website had many traits in common with a phishing\nwebsite: it was not hosted on a domain registered to Equifax, it had a flawed TLS implementation, and it ran on WordPress\nwhich is not generally considered suitable for high-security applications.[17]\n\nThese issues led Open DNS\nto classify it as a phishing site and block access.[17]\n\nMoreover, members of the public wanting to use the Equifax website to learn if their data had been compromised had to provide a last name and six digits of their social security number.[64]\n\n","The website set up to check whether a person's personal data had been breached (trustedidpremier.com) was determined by security experts and others to return apparently random results instead of accurate information.[64]\n\nAs with https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, this website, too, was registered and constructed like a phishing website, and it was flagged as such by several web browsers.[65]\n\n","The Trusted ID Premier website contained terms of use\n, dated September 6, 2017 (the day before Equifax announced the security breach) which included an arbitration clause\nwith a class action waiver.[66]\n\n[67]\n\nAttorneys said that the arbitration clause was ambiguous and that it could require consumers who accepted it to arbitrate claims related to the cybersecurity incident.[67]\n\nAccording to Polly Mosendz and Shahien Nasiripour, \"some fear[ed] that simply using an Equifax website to check whether their information was compromised bound them to arbitration\".[68]\n\nThe equifax.com website has separate terms of use with an arbitration clause and class action waiver, but, according to Brian Fung of The Washington Post\n, \"it's unclear if that applies to the credit monitoring program\".[69]\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\ndemanded that Equifax remove the arbitration clause.[70]\n\nResponding to arbitration-related concerns, on September 8, Equifax issued a statement stating that \"in response to consumer inquiries, we have made it clear that the arbitration clause and class action waiver included in the Equifax and TrustedID Premier terms of use does not apply to this cybersecurity incident.\"[70]\n\nJoel Winston, a data protection lawyer, argued that the announcement disclaiming the arbitration clause \"means nothing\" because the terms of use state that they are the \"entire agreement\" between the parties.[70]\n\nThe arbitration clause was later removed from equifaxsecurity2017.com,[70]\n\nand the equifax.com terms of use were amended on September 12 to state that they do not apply to www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, www.trustedidpremier.com, or www.trustedid.com and to exclude claims arising from those sites or the security breach from arbitration.[71]\n\n[72]\n\n","Responding to continuing public outrage,[73]\n\nEquifax announced on September 12 that they \"are waiving all Security Freeze fees for the next 30 days\".[74]\n\n","Equifax has been criticized by security experts for registering a new domain name for the site name instead of using a subdomain of equifax.com\n. On September 20, it was reported that Equifax had been mistakenly linking to an unofficial \"fake\" web site instead of their own breach notification site in at least eight separate tweets\n, unwittingly helping to direct a reported 200,000 hits to the imitation site. A software engineer named Nick Sweeting created the unauthorized Equifax web site to demonstrate how the official site could easily be confused with a phishing\nsite. Sweeting's site was upfront to visitors that it was not official, however, telling visitors who had entered sensitive information that \"you just got bamboozled! this isnt [sic] a secure site! Tweet to @equifax to get them to change it to equifax.com before thousands of people loose [sic] their info to phishing sites!\n\" Equifax apologized for the \"confusion\" and deleted the tweets linking to this site.[75]\n\n[76]\n\n[77]\n\n","In September 2017, Brian Krebs\nrevealed that an Argentinian arm of Equifax had left private data from approximately 14,000 consumers, and more than 100 staff members, available to anyone who entered \"admin\" as both the username and password for one of its online systems.[78]\n\n[79]\n\n","On September 7, 2017, the same day as Equifax announced a large security breach\n, Equifax removed its official mobile apps\nfrom the Apple App Store\nand from Google Play\n.[80]\n\nWhile these apps themselves were not reportedly connected to that breach, they had security flaws of their own, being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks\nowing to some parts using HTTP\ninstead of HTTPS\n.[81]\n\n","On October 8, 2017, Krebs reported that The Work Number\n, a website operated by Equifax's TALX\ndivision, exposed the salary histories for employees of tens of thousands of US companies to anyone in possession of the employee's Social Security Number and date of birth.[82]\n\n[83]\n\nFor roughly half the US population, both of the latter pieces of data are known to be in possession of criminals, following Equifax's May–July 2017 security breach\n.[82]\n\n[83]\n\n","On October 12, 2017, Equifax's website was reported to have been offering visitors malware\nvia drive-by download\n.[84]\n\n[85]\n\nThe malware was disguised as an update for Adobe Flash\n.[84]\n\n[85]\n\n[86]\n\n[87]\n\nAt that time, only 3 out of 65 top anti-malware products provided protection against the particular malware, meaning that many visitors were at risk of having their computers infected if visiting the Equifax website.[86]\n\n","On October 13, 2017, the attack was revealed to have been performed by hijacking third-party analytics\nJavaScript\nfrom Digital River\nbrand FireClick.[88]\n\n[89]\n\n","Also on October 13, 2017, the US Internal Revenue Service\nwas reported to have suspended a $7.2 million contract with Equifax, as a result of the attack.[90]\n\n","The company has been fined by the Federal Trade Commission on two occasions for violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In 2000, Equifax, along with Experian and TransUnion, was fined $2.5 million for blocking and delaying phone calls from consumers trying to get information about their credit. In 2003, the FTC took Equifax to court for the same reason and settled its lawsuit with the company for a fine of $250,000.[91]\n\n[92]\n\n","In July 2013, a federal jury in Oregon awarded $18.6 million to Julie Miller of Marion County against Equifax for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.ad'_St._Louis_County_woman_pleads_to_her_bank_93-0\" class=\"reference\"\u003edead'_St._Louis_County_woman_pleads_to_her_bank-93\"\u003e[93]\n\nIn her lawsuit, Miller alleged Equifax had merged her credit reports with another person with a different Social Security number, date of birth, and address. Miller contacted Equifax repeatedly in writing and over the telephone, but Equifax refused to delete dozens of false collection accounts from Miller’s credit report.[94]\n\nThe award included $18.4 million in punitive damages, and $180,000 in compensatory damages. Miller’s lawyer, Justin Baxter, explained that the false reporting damaged Miller's reputation, she was denied credit, and her private information was given to businesses Miller had no relationship with.[95]\n\nThe jury’s verdict is believed to be the largest award in an individual case under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.[96]\n\nAn Equifax spokesperson said that Equifax is considering appealing the jury’s verdict.[97]\n\nA federal judge reduced the award to $1.62 million in 2014.[98]\n\n","In 2014, Equifax and Heartland Bank were sued by Kimberly Haman of the St. Louis area for reporting she was dead.[99]\n\n[100]\n\nA Heartland Bank spokesperson said the bank \"immediately investigated and contacted the credit reporting agencies after Haman reported\" she was still alive.[99]\n\nAn Equifax \"spokesperson told the Post-Dispatch that Equifax blocked the Heartland account information from appearing on Haman’s credit report after a reporter’s inquiry.\"_93-1\" class=\"reference\"\u003enk-93\"\u003e[93]\n\n[99]\n\n","In April 2014, Equifax was sued in New York federal court by God Gazarov, who claimed the company erroneously reports him as having no credit history because of his unusual first name.p id=\"cite_ref-God_Just_Wants_Some_Credit,_So_He's_Suing_Equifax_101-0\" class=\"reference\"\u003ehref=\"#cite_note-God_Just_Wants_Some_Credit,_So_He's_Suing_Equifax-101\"\u003e[101]\n\n","p id=\"cite_ref-God_Just_Wants_Some_Credit,_So_He's_Suing_Equifax_101-0\" class=\"reference\"\u003ehref=\"#cite_note-God_Just_Wants_Some_Credit,_So_He's_Suing_Equifax-101\"\u003e[101]\n","href=\"#cite_note-God_Just_Wants_Some_Credit,_So_He's_Suing_Equifax-101\"\u003e[101]","On November 4, 2015, it was reported that a group of five Oklahomans had sued the company, claiming that Equifax \"violated laws which require financial institutions to protect the security of their customers' personal information.\"[102]\n\nEquifax selected the law firm DLA Piper\nto work on the case in D.C.

Such credit information institutions reduce the effect of asymmetric information\nbetween borrowers and lenders, and alleviate problems of adverse selection\nand moral hazard. For example, adequate credit information could facilitate lenders in screening and monitoring borrowers as well as avoiding giving loans to high risk individuals.[3]\n\nThis helps lenders assess credit worthiness, the ability to pay back a loan\n, and can affect the interest rate\nand other terms of a loan. Interest rates are not the same for everyone, but instead can be based on risk-based pricing\n, a form of price discrimination based on the different expected risks of different borrowers, as set out in their credit rating\n. Consumers with poor credit repayment histories or court adjudicated debt obligations like tax liens or bankruptcies will pay a higher annual interest rate than consumers who don't have these factors. Additionally, decision-makers in areas unrelated to consumer credit, including employment screening and underwriting of property and casualty insurance, increasingly depend on credit records, as studies have shown that such records have predictive value.[4]\n\nAt the same time, consumers also benefit from a good credit information system because it reduces the effect of credit monopoly from banks[5]\n\nand provides incentives for borrowers to repay their loans on time.","In the U.S., consumer reporting agencies collect and aggregate personal information, financial data, and alternative data\non individuals from a variety of sources called data furnishers with which the reporting agencies have a relationship. Data furnishers are typically creditors, lenders, utilities, debt collection agencies (credit bureaus) and the courts (i.e. public records\n) that a consumer has had a relationship or experience with. Data furnishers report their payment experience with the consumer to the credit reporting agencies. The data provided by the furnishers as well as collected by the bureaus are then aggregated into the consumer reporting agency's data repository or files. The resulting information is made available on request to customers of the consumer reporting agencies' for the purposes of credit risk\nassessment, credit scoring\nor for other purposes such as employment consideration or leasing an apartment. Given the large number of consumer borrowers, these credit scores tend to be mechanistic. To simplify the analytical process for their customers, the different consumer reporting agencies can apply a mathematical algorithm\nto provide a score the customer can use to more rapidly assess the likelihood that an individual will repay a particular debt\ngiven the frequency that other individuals in similar situations have defaulted. Most consumer welfare\nadvocates advise individuals to review their credit reports\nat least once a year to ensure they are accurate.","In addition to providing credit information, these services have become authoritative sources of identity information against which people can be verified using an identity verification service\nand knowledge-based authentication\n.","The establishment of Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL\n), India's first Credit Information Bureau, is an effort made by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India to improve the functionality and stability of the Indian financial system by containing non-performing assets (NPAs) while improving credit grantors' portfolio quality.","CIBIL\nwas promoted by State Bank of India\n(SBI), Housing Development Finance Corporation\n(HDFC), Dun \u0026amp; Bradstreet Information Services India Private Limited (D\u0026amp;B) and TransUnion International Inc.

High Mark launched India's first micro finance bureau in early 2011 \u0026amp; today operates the world's largest micro finance bureau besides offering traditional bureau services for the Retail lending industry.","eCIB ECIB\nis a software for monitoring credit reports all across Pakistan. State Bank of Pakistan monitors the Software and all the Financial Institutions in Pakistan are required to have this software installed. A monthly process updates the reports at the State Bank end.","The membership with CIB, as per instructions of SBP, is mandatory for all Banks, Developmental Financial Institutions (DFIs) and Micro Finance Banks (MFBs) respectively. No financial institution can access the CIB database without obtaining membership of CIB of State Bank of Pakistan.","All member financial institutions are required to submit entire borrowers' records online to CIB on monthly basis. This information is submitted within a period of fortnight from the date of close of month.","The Electronic Credit Information Bureau (CIB) was established by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in December, 1992. The scope and activities of CIB are governed under the provisions of Banking Companies Ordinance (BCO), 1962. The Section 25(A) vests powers with SBP to call for credit information in such manner as it may deem necessary and make such information available to any banking company.","In the United Kingdom, the three credit reference agencies are Experian\n, Equifax\nand Callcredit\n, which works closely with its US partner, TransUnion\n.","Most banks and other credit-granting organisations subscribe to one or more of these organisations to ensure the quality of their lending. This includes companies who sell goods or services on credit such as credit card\nissuers, utility companies and store card issuers. Subscribing organisations are expected to provide relevant data to maintain the common data pool.","Credit reference agencies are bound by the Data Protection Act 1998\n, which requires that data relating to identifiable individuals must be accurate, relevant, held for a proper purpose and not out-of-date. Individuals have a legal right to access data held on them. The Act specifically gives consumers the right to request to a copy of their credit file by post for a fee of £2[7]\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n\nThe UK credit reference agencies will also allow consumers to access their credit report on-line free for a trial period, after which a monthly or quarterly fee may be charged for continued access.","The activities of Credit Reference Agencies are governed by the Consumer Credit Act 1974\n.","In the United States, there is no legal term for a credit bureau under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act\n(FCRA). A consumer reporting agency\nis often abbreviated in the industry as CRA.","In the United States, key consumer reporting agency consumer protections and general rules or governing guidelines for both the consumer reporting agencies and data furnishers are the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act\n(FCRA), Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA), Fair Credit Billing Act\n(FCBA), and Regulation B.","Two government bodies share responsibility for the oversight\nof consumer reporting agencies and those that furnish data to them. The Federal Trade Commission\n(FTC) has oversight for the consumer reporting agencies. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(OCC) charters, regulates, and supervises all national banks with regard to the data they furnish consumer reporting agencies.","Most U.S. consumer credit information is collected and kept by the four national traditional consumer reporting agencies: Experian\n(formerly TRW Information Systems \u0026amp; Services\nand the CCN Group), Equifax\n, TransUnion\n, and Innovis\n(which was purchased from First Data Corporation\nin 1999 by CBC Companies\n). These organizations are for-profit businesses and possess no government affiliation. Though they are competitors, they are members of a trade organization called the Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA) to establish reporting standards and lobby on behalf of their industry issues in Washington. Current reporting standards accepted by the four U.S. CRAs are Metro and Metro2. The Metro2 standard is defined in the annual CDIA publication, the Credit Reporting Resource Guide\n. Consumers are entitled to a free annual credit report from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies, Equifax\n, Experian\nand TransUnion\n. Consumers can go to annualcreditreport.com\n, the Internet site maintained by the three companies, to get their free report.","There are dozens of other similar information collection and reporting firms that analyze and sell information about consumers for other purposes, including those who aggregate multiple credit data sources and provide lenders with customized analytical tools. Furthermore, there are also non-traditional credit reporting agencies.","PRBC\n(Payment Reporting Builds Credit, Inc.) is a national alternative credit bureau\n. Incorporated in March 2002, PRBC enables consumers to self-enroll and build a positive credit file by reporting their on-time payments (such as rent, utilities, cable, and phone) that are not automatically reported to the three traditional credit bureaus.","In the U.S., there are six business or commercial bureau repositories (in alphabetical order): Cortera, Dun \u0026amp; Bradstreet, Experian Business, Equifax Commercial, PayNet, and Southeastern Association of Credit Management (SACM). While not a credit reporting agency, Small Business Financial Exchange, Inc. (SBFE) is a not for profit trade association for small business lenders from all types of industries. SBFE gathers and protects small business payment data for its Members to help build a true and accurate picture of small business then facilitates the exchange of that data to specific business credit reporting agencies that have a Certified Vendor licensing agreement with SBFE. SBFE only allows business credit reporting agencies to license its Member’s data for risk management purposes, marketing use of the data is not allowed by SBFE.","In the case of Dun \u0026amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc.\n\n, 472 U.S. 749 (1985) the U.S. Supreme Court held that a consumer reporting agency may be liable if it was careless in reporting an impending or past bankruptcy\nfiling of a business that is not a public figure\n.","Iran Credit Scoring (ICS) Company is the sole licensed national consumer reporting agency offering credit information services to respective members in Iran. ICS is a private equity company established in 2006, by all Iranian banks (private and public banks) and other financial institutions such as leasing and insurance companies, operating in the Islamic Republic of Iran within the context of the current banking act and regulations issued by Iran Ministry of economic Affairs and Finance and Central Bank of Iran.","The main Objective of ICS is to help credit providers make improved lending decisions quickly and more objectively. To achieve this, ICS intends to aggregate credit related information among participating members to provide credit providers with a more complete risk profile of the customer (natural persons, unincorporated entities, corporate entities or any other entity).","The ICS tend to aggregates credit related information among participating members to provide the credit providers with a more complete risk profile of the customer. Participating members disclose credit related information to and obtain information from the CRA to assess the credit worthiness of their existing and prospective customers, which enhances the credit providers risk assessment capabilities to determine whether or not the customer is likely to repay.","In 1981, Ferdinand Marcos\n, then President of the Republic of the Philippines, issued a Letter of Instructions No. 1107 mandating the Central Bank of the Philippines\nto analyze the probability of establishing and funding the operation of a credit bureau in the Philippines\ndue to the disturbing increase of failures on corporate borrowers.","In adherence to the order, Central Bank of the Philippines organized the Credit Information Exchange System under the department of Loans and Credit. It was created to engage in collating, developing and analyzing credit information on individuals, institutions, business entities and other business concerns. It aims to develop and undertake the continuing exchange of credit data within its members and subscribers and to provide an impartial source of credit information for debtors, creditors and the public. This will also cooperate and guide government agencies in their credit information requirements.","On April 14, 1982, Credit Information Bureau, Inc.\nwas incorporated as a non-stock, non-profit corporation. (See: Presidential Decree No. 1941 [7])","In 1982, Credit Information Bureau, Inc.\nwas established through the power of Presidential decree 1941 and created under Central Bank of the Philippines, now Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\n(BSP) department of Loans and Credit, the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) and the Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines (FINEX); to initiate a credit information exchange system in the country.","In 1997, Credit Information Bureau, Inc. was incorporated and transformed into a private entity and became CIBI Information, Inc.\n\n","In 2008, Republic Act No. 9510\nalso known as Credit Information System Act of 2008\ngave way to the creation of Credit Information Corporation\nas the new government-owned and controlled credit registry in the country.","In 2011, TransUnion Information Solutions, Inc. begins operations in the Philippines, partnering with Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), Banco de Oro Unibank (BDO), Metrobank Card Corporation, HSBC and Citibank Philippines to launch the country's first comprehensive, international private credit bureau.","Contributing TransUnion members are given access to credit information in the form of a credit report, consumer bureau score and additional value-added services. TransUnion Philippines aims to strengthen the Philippine financial system through increased access to credit for borrowers and reduced risk to lenders.","The Saudi Credit Bureau (SIMAH) is the first and sole licensed national credit bureau offering consumer and commercial credit information services to respective members in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It was established in 2002 and began operating on the ground in 2004 under the supervisory umbrella of Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA).","The idea goes back into 1998 when national commercial banks and SAMA thought of establishing a Saudi credit bureau offering consumer and commercial information. Meetings were held for this purpose and officials were assigned to coordinate with the World Bank to consider existing international experiences for some countries to establish a credit bureau based on methodological and knowledge approaches to contribute to the Saudi national economy.","SIMAH was then established to operate within the context of the current banking act and regulations issued by SAMA.","In the United States, a percentage of credit reports provided by consumer reporting agencies contain inaccuracies.[10]\n\nAccording to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), common causes of errors broadly fall into one of two categories: inclusion of incorrect information and exclusion of correct information.[11]\n\nReasons for the inaccuracies include consumers providing inaccurate information to the consumer reporting agencies; incorrect or incomplete data input by furnishers, or failing to provide data to the consumer reporting agency; and incorrect or incomplete data (or data applied to the wrong consumer) by the consumer reporting agency.[11]\n\nAccording to Avery, Calem, and Canner in Credit Report Accuracy and Access to Credit\n, \"the parties that bear the costs of correcting errors or providing more timely and complete information [data furnishers and consumer reporting agencies] may not receive much benefit from the improvement in accuracy.\"[4]\n\n","The formula to calculate consumer credit scores by a consumer reporting agency is proprietary and considered a trade secret of the agency in the United States.[12]\n\n","Some consumer reporting agencies in the United States provide two credit scores - an 'educational' score to the consumer and a customary FICO-like score to the lender or business. Liz Weston writes that some consumer advocates refer to these other [educational] credit scores as \"FAKO scores\" (a play on acronym\nof FICO).[13]\n\nIn consideration of the fact that algorithms which rate people are used in a discriminatory fashion to deny people legal rights (employment, insurance, credit, etc.), those very algorithms act as law. The law says that if one does \"this\" or if one \"does\" that, then they will be afforded different treatment and opportunities. What needs to be done though remains a secret. Therefore, people are called on to abide by a secret law. At least two things need to be examined: First is that the operation of a more general \"chilling effect\" that imposing a non disclosed law may have and; Secondly the social effects of discrimination, which take an entirely new light in the context of no longer discriminating against race creed color age or religion, but on the basis of a number, a number which has been assigned to all members of society reflecting information about that person which is unknown. Accordingly, there can be no definition at present of what information credit repositories collect or even what the use of that information is or what it reflects. These questions can only be answered if the algorithms were publicized and expert statisticians were permitted to examine them and improve on the intent of the model, which intent is also undisclosed.","According to David Szwak, a partner in Bodenheimer, Jones \u0026amp; Szwak which specializes in insurance law and litigation against consumer reporting agencies, some consumer reporting agencies in the United States maintain a VIP database of special consumers such as members of Congress\n, judges, actors and celebrities.[14]\n\nThe VIP database is specially administered by the bureau, which ensures the credit report of the consumer is accurate and not negatively handled. The database exists because individuals in the VIP database could cause significant problems for the bureaus, including negative publicity and legislative action which could adversely affect the industry.[15]\n\nSo far an economic model to describe this industry has not been attempted, while the fundamentals are counter intuitive to any market known, since other industries (finance, banking, insurance) sponsor consumer reporting agencies to process information while consumers pay CRAs to receive that information. The utility of the consumer is hard to calculate since the consumer is given no recourse to correct mistakes processed about them, hence the dynamics of this triangle involving consumers, credit reporters, and sponsoring industries remain undefined.","Commercial credit reporting and scoring bureaus also exist, and can be used to evaluate the likelihood of a business paying creditors. Examples of commercial credit reports\nare the Paydex\nscore from Dun \u0026amp; Bradstreet\n, the Risk Rating from Creditsafe\n, the Experian\nIntelliscore\n, the CPR Score from Cortera\n, the GCS score from Global Credit Services, and the CIC Score and NACM National Trade Credit Report from the National Association of Credit Management\n.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94de580262df3aa1b2f538"},"content":{"contents":["A credit score\nis a numerical expression based on a level analysis of a person's credit files, to represent the creditworthiness\nof an individual. A credit score is primarily based on a credit report\ninformation typically sourced from credit bureaus\n.","Lenders, such as banks\nand credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt\n. Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what interest rate\n, and what credit limits. Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue. The use of credit or identity scoring\nprior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a trusted system\n.","Credit scoring is not limited to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques. Digital finance companies such as online lenders also use alternative data sources to calculate the creditworthiness of borrowers. Credit scoring also has much overlap with data mining\n, which uses many similar techniques. These techniques combine thousands of factors but are similar or identical.","","","In Australia, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.","Although logistic\n(or non-linear\n) probability modelling is still the most popular means by which to develop scorecards, various other methods offer powerful alternatives, including MARS\n, CART\n, CHAID\n, and random forests\n.","Prior to March 12, 2014 Veda Advantage\n, the main provider of credit file data, provided only a negative credit reporting system containing information on applications for credit and adverse listings indicating a default under a credit contract.","With the subsequent introduction of positive reporting, lending companies have begun an uptake of its usage with some implementing risk based pricing\nto set lending rates.","In Austria\n, credit scoring is done as a blacklist. Consumers who did not pay bills end up on the blacklists that are held by different credit bureaus\n.[1]\n\nHaving an entry on the black list may result in the denial of contracts. Certain enterprises including telecom carriers use the list on a regular basis. Banks also use these lists, but rather inquire about security and income when considering loans. Beside these lists several agencies and credit bureaus provide credit scoring of consumers.","According to the Austrian Data Protection Act\n, consumers must opt-in for the use of their private data for any purpose. Consumers can also withhold permission to use the data later, making illegal any further distribution or use of the collected data.[2]\n\nConsumers also have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year.[3]\n\nWrong or unlawfully collected data must be deleted or corrected.[4]\n\n","The system of credit reports and scores in Canada is very similar to that in the United States and India, with two of the same reporting agencies active in the country: Equifax\nand TransUnion\n. (Experian\n, which entered the Canadian market with the purchase of Northern Credit Bureaus in 2008, announced the closing of its Canadian operations as of April 18, 2009).","There are, however, some key differences. One is that, unlike in the United States, where a consumer is allowed only one free copy of their credit report a year, in Canada, the consumer may order a free copy of their credit report any number of times in a year, as long as the request is made in writing, and as long as the consumer asks for a printed copy to be delivered by mail.[5]\n\n[6]\n\nThis request by the consumer is noted in the credit report as a 'soft inquiry', so it has no effect on their credit score. According to Equifax's ScorePower Report, Equifax Beacon scores range from 300 to 900. Trans Union Emperica scores also range from 300 and 900.","The Government of Canada\noffers a free publication called Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score\n.[7]\n\nThis publication provides sample credit report and credit score documents, with explanations of the notations and codes that are used. It also contains general information on how to build or improve credit history, and how to check for signs that identity theft\nhas occurred. The publication is available online at the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada\n. Paper copies can also be ordered at no charge for residents of Canada.","The credit scoring is widely used in Denmark by the banks and a number of private companies within telco and others. The credit scoring is split in two:","For privates, the credit scoring is always made by the creditor. For businesses it is either made by the creditor or by a third party.","There are a few companies who have specialized in developing credit scorecards in Denmark:","The credit scorecards in Denmark are mainly based on information provided by the applicant and publicly available data. It is very restricted by legislation compared to its neighbouring countries.","In Germany, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.","Consumers have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year. At present Schufa\n, the main provider of credit file data, provides scores for about three-quarters of the German population.","In India\n, there are four credit information companies licensed by Reserve Bank of India\n. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL\n) has functioned as a Credit Information Company from January 2001.[8]\n\nSubsequently, in 2010, Experian\n,[8]\n\nEquifax\n[9]\n\nand Highmark\n[10]\n\nwere given licenses by Reserve Bank of India\nto operate as Credit Information Companies in India.","Although all the four credit information companies have developed their individual credit scores, the most popular is CIBIL\ncredit score. The CIBIL\ncredit score is a three-digit number that represents a summary of individuals' credit history and credit rating. This score ranges from 300 to 900, with 900 being the best score. Individuals with no credit history will have a score of -1. If the credit history is less than six months, the score will be 0. CIBIL\ncredit score takes time to build up and usually it takes between 18 and 36 months or more of credit usage to obtain a satisfactory credit score.","In Norway\n, credit scoring services are provided by three credit scoring agencies: Dun \u0026amp; Bradstreet\n, Experian\nand Lindorff Decision. Credit scoring is based on publicly available information such as demographic data, tax returns, taxable income and any Betalingsanmerkning\n(non-payment records) that might be registered on the credit-scored individual. Upon being scored, an individual will receive a notice (written or by e-mail) from the scoring agency stating who performed the credit score as well as any information provided in the score. In addition, many credit institutions use custom scorecards based on any number of parameters. Credit scores range between 300 and 900.","Credit scoring is used throughout the credit industry in South Africa\n, with the likes of banks, micro-lenders, clothing retailers, furniture retailers, specialized lenders and insurers all using credit scores. Currently all four retail credit bureau\noffer credit bureau scores. The data stored by the credit bureaus include both positive and negative data, increasing the predictive power of the individual scores. TransUnion\n(formerly ITC) offer the Empirica Score which is, as of mid-2010, in its 4th generation. The Empirica score is segmented into two suites: the account origination (AO) and account management (AM). Experian\nSouth Africa likewise has a Delphi credit score with their fourth generation about to be released (late 2010). In 2011, Compuscan\nreleased Compuscore ABC, a scoring suite which predicts the probability of customer default throughout the credit life cycle. Six years later, Compuscan introduced Compuscore PSY, a 3-digit psychometric-based credit bureau score used by lenders to make informed lending decisions on thin files or marginal declines.[11]\n\n","Sweden has a system for credit scoring that aims to find people with a history of neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make payments after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish Enforcement Authority\nwhich is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a Betalningsanmärkning\n(non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company.[12]\n\nThis kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.[13]\n\n","If a person gets an injunction to pay issued by the Enforcement Authority, it is possible to dispute it. Then the party requesting the payment must show its correctness in district court. Failure to dispute is seen as admitting the debt. If the debtor loses the court trial, costs for the trial are added to the debt. Taxes and authority fees must always be paid on demand unless payment has already been made.[14]\n\n","Every person with a Swedish national identification number\nmust register a valid address, even if living abroad, since sent letters are considered to have been delivered to that person once they reach the registered address. As an example, Swedish astronaut Christer Fuglesang\ngot a Betalningsanmärkning\nsince a car he had ordered, and therefore owned, passed a toll station for the Stockholm congestion tax\n. At the time, he was living in the USA training for his first Space Shuttle mission\nand had an old invalid address registered for the car. Letters with payment requests did not reach him on time. The case was appealed and retracted, but the non-payment record remained for three years since it could not be retracted according to the law.[15]\n\n","Credit Scoring in the United Kingdom is very different to that of the United States and other nations. There is no such thing as a universal credit score or credit rating in the UK.\nEach lender will assess potential borrowers on their own criteria, and these algorithms are effectively trade secrets. \"Credit scores\" which are available for individuals to see and provided from Credit Reference Agencies such as Call Credit, Equifax and Experian are the result of marketing departments at credit agencies realising they could sell a product to consumers and are not used by lenders. Lenders instead use their own internal scoring mechanism.","The most popular statistical technique used is logistic regression\nto predict a binary outcome: bad debt or no bad debt. Some banks also build regression models that predict the amount of bad debt a customer may incur. Typically this is much harder to predict, and most banks focus only on the binary outcome.","Credit scoring is closely regulated only by the Financial Conduct Authority\nwhen used for the purposes of the Advanced approach to Capital Adequacy under Basel II\nregulations.","Credit scoring is closely regulated in the UK, with the industry regulator being the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Consumers can also send complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service if they experience problems with any Credit Reference Agency.[16]\n\n","It is very difficult for a consumer to know in advance whether they have a high enough credit score to be accepted for credit with a given lender. This situation is due to the complexity and structure of credit scoring, which differs from one lender to another.","Lenders need not reveal their credit score head, nor need they reveal the minimum credit score required for the applicant to be accepted. Owing only to this lack of information to the consumer, it is impossible for him or her to know in advance if they will pass a lender's credit scoring requirements. However, it may still be useful for consumers to gauge their chances of being successful with their credit or loan applications by checking their credit score prior to applying.","If the applicant is declined for credit, the lender is not obliged to reveal the exact reason why. However industry associations including the Finance and Leasing Association\noblige their members to provide a satisfactory reason. Credit-bureau data sharing agreements also require that an applicant declined based on credit-bureau data is told that this is the reason and the address of the credit bureau must be provided.","In the United States, a credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit files, that in theory represents the creditworthiness\nof that person, which is the likelihood that people will pay their bills. A credit score is primarily based on credit report\ninformation, typically from one of the three major credit bureaus\n: Experian\n, TransUnion\n, and Equifax\n. Income and employment history (or lack thereof) are not considered by the major credit bureaus when calculating credit scores.","There are different methods of calculating credit scores. FICO scores\n, the most widely used type of credit score, is a credit score developed by FICO\n, previously known as Fair Isaac Corporation\n. As of 2018, there are currently 29 different versions of FICO scores in use in the United States. Some of these versions are \"industry specific\" scores, that is, scores produced for particular market segments, including automotive lending and bankcard (credit card) lending. Industry-specific FICO scores produced for automotive lending are formulated differently than FICO scores produced for bankcard lending. Nearly every consumer will have different FICO scores depending upon which type of FICO score is ordered by a lender; for example, a consumer with several paid-in-full car loans but no reported credit card payment history will generally score better on a FICO automotive-enhanced score than on a FICO bankcard-enhanced score. FICO also produces several \"general purpose\" scores which are not tailored to any particular industry. Industry-specific FICO scores range from 250 to 900, whereas general purpose scores range from 300 to 850.","FICO scores are used by many mortgage lenders that use a risk-based system to determine the possibility that the borrower may default on financial obligations to the mortgage lender. For most mortgages originated in the United States, three credit scores are obtained on a consumer: a Beacon 5.0 score (Beacon is a trademark of FICO) which is calculated from the consumer's Equifax credit history, a FICO Model II score, which is calculated from the consumer's Experian credit history, and a Classic04 score, which is calculated from the consumer's Trans Union history.","Credit bureaus\nalso often re-sell FICO scores directly to consumers, often a general-purpose FICO 8 score. Previously, the credit bureaus also sold their own credit scores which they developed themselves, and which did not require payment to FICO to utilize: Equifax\n's RISK score and Experian\n's PLUS score. However, as of 2018, these scores are no longer sold by the credit bureaus. Trans Union offers a Vantage 3.0 score for sale to consumers, which is a version of the VantageScore\ncredit score. In addition, many large lenders, including the major credit card issuers, have developed their own proprietary scoring models.","Studies have shown scores to be predictive of risk in the underwriting of both credit and insurance.[17]\n\n[18]\n\n[19]\n\nSome studies even suggest that most consumers are the beneficiaries of lower credit costs and insurance premiums due to the use of credit scores.[18]\n\n[20]\n\n","New credit scores have been developed in the last decade by companies such as Scorelogix, PRBC\n, L2C, Innovis\netc. which do not use bureau data to predict creditworthiness. Scorelogix's JSS Credit Score uses a different set of risk factors, such as the borrower's job stability, income, income sufficiency, and impact of economy, in predicting credit risk, and the use of such alternative credit scores is on the rise. These new types of credit scores are often combined with FICO or bureau scores to improve the accuracy of predictions. Most lenders today use some combination of bureau scores and alternative credit scores to develop better understanding of a borrower's ability to pay. It is widely recognized that FICO is a measure of past ability to pay. New credit scores that focus more on future ability to pay are being deployed to enhance credit risk models. L2C offers an alternative credit score that uses utility payment histories to determine creditworthiness, and many lenders use this score in addition to bureau scores to make lending decisions. Many lenders use Scorelogix's JSS score in addition to bureau scores, given that the JSS score incorporates job and income stability to determine whether the borrower will have the ability to repay debt in the future. It is thought that the FICO score will remain the dominant score, but it will likely be used in conjunction with other alternative credit scores that offer other pictures of risk.","Usage of credit histories in employment screenings has increased from 19% in 1996 to 42% in 2006.[21]\n\n:1\n\nHowever, credit reports for employment screening purposes do not include credit scores.[21]\n\n:2\n\n","Americans are entitled to one free credit report in every 12-month period from each of the three credit bureaus, but are not entitled to receive a free credit score. The three credit bureaus run Annualcreditreport.com\n, where users can get their free credit reports. Credit scores are available as an add-on feature of the report for a fee. If the consumer disputes an item on a credit report obtained using the free system, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act\n(FCRA), the credit bureaus have 45 days to investigate, rather than 30 days for reports obtained otherwise.[22]\n\n","Alternatively, consumers wishing to obtain their credit scores can in some cases purchase them separately from the credit bureaus or can purchase their FICO score directly from FICO\n. Credit scores (including FICO scores) are also made available free by subscription to one of the many credit report monitoring\nservices available from the credit bureaus or other third parties, although to actually get the scores free from most such services, one must use a credit card to sign up for a free trial subscription of the service and then cancel before the first monthly charge. Websites like WalletHub\n, Credit Sesame\nand Credit Karma\nprovide free credit scores with no credit card required, using the TransUnion\nVantageScore 3.0 model. Until March 2009, holders of credit cards issued by Washington Mutual\nwere offered a free FICO score each month through the bank's Web site. (Chase\n, which took over Washington Mutual in 2008, discontinued this practice in March, 2009.)[23]\n\nChase\nresumed the practice of offering a free FICO score in March, 2010 of select card members to the exclusion of the majority of former WAMU card holders.","Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act\n, a consumer is entitled to a free credit report (but not a free credit score) within 60 days of any adverse action (e.g., being denied credit, or receiving substandard credit terms from a lender) taken as a result of their credit score. Under the Wall Street reform\nbill passed on July 22, 2010, a consumer is entitled to receive a free credit score if they are denied a loan or insurance due to their credit score.[24]\n\n","The generic or classic FICO credit score ranges between 300 and 850. The VantageScore 3.0 score ranges from 300-850. The old VantageScore was between 501 and 990.","The first step to interpreting a score is to identify the source of the credit score and its use. There are numerous scores based on various scoring models sold to lenders and other users. The most common was created by FICO and is called FICO score. FICO\nis a publicly traded corporation (under the ticker symbol FICO) that created the best-known and most widely used credit score model in the United States. FICO produces scoring models which are installed at and distributed by the three largest national credit repositories in the U.S (TransUnion, Equifax and Experian) and the two national credit repositories in Canada (TransUnion Canada and Equifax Canada). FICO controls the vast majority of the credit score market in the United States and Canada although there are several other competing players that collectively share a very small percentage of the market.","In the United States, the median\ngeneric FICO score was 723 in 2006 and 711 in 2011.[25]\n\nThe performance definition of the FICO risk score (its stated design objective) is to predict the likelihood that a consumer will go 90 days past due or worse in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated. The higher the consumer's score, the less likely he or she will go 90 days past due in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated. Because different lending uses (mortgage, automobile, credit card) have different parameters, FICO algorithms are adjusted according to the predictability of that use. For this reason, a person might have a higher credit score for a revolving credit card debt when compared to a mortgage credit score taken at the same point in time.","The interpretation of a credit score will vary by lender, industry, and the economy as a whole. While 640 has been a divider between \"prime\" and \"subprime\", all considerations about score revolve around the strength of the economy in general and investors' appetites for risk in providing the funding for borrowers in particular when the score is evaluated. In 2010, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) tightened its guidelines regarding credit scores to a small degree, but lenders who have to service and sell the securities packaged for sale into the secondary market largely raised their minimum score to 640 in the absence of strong compensating factors in the borrower's loan profile. In another housing example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began charging extra for loans over 75% of the value that have scores below 740. Furthermore, private mortgage insurance companies will not even provide mortgage insurance for borrowers with scores below 660. Therefore, \"prime\" is a product of the lender's appetite for the risk profile of the borrower at the time that the borrower is asking for the loan.","Several factors affect individual's credit scores. One factor is the amount an individual borrowed as compared to the amount of credit available to the individual. As an individual borrows, or leverages, more money, the individual's credit score decreases."],"title":"Credit score","rels":["/wiki/Experian","/wiki/Bisnode","/wiki/Alternative_data","/wiki/Credit_bureau","/wiki/Credit_history","/wiki/Credit_reference","/wiki/Credit_scorecards","/wiki/Credit_score","/wiki/Credit_score"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Credit_score"}

The findings of the U.S. Congress that led to the Act, and the Act's key regulatory innovations, set the direction of information privacy\nin the U.S. and the world for the next fifty years. Key among these innovations was the determination that there should be no secret databases that are used to make decisions about a person's life, that individuals should have a right to see and challenge the information held in such databases, and that information in such a database should expire after a reasonable amount of time.","Commonly referred to as credit reports, a consumer report \"contains information about your credit - and some bill repayment history - and the status of your credit accounts. This information includes how often you make your payments on time, how much credit you have, how much credit you have available, how much credit you are using, and whether a debt or bill collector is collecting on money you owe. Credit reports also can contain rental repayment information if you are a property renter. It also can contain public records such as liens, judgments, and bankruptcies that provide insight into your financial status and obligations.\"[3]\n\n","A 2015 study released by the Federal Trade Commission found that 23% of consumers identified inaccurate information in their credit reports.[4]\n\nUnder the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act\n(FACTA), an amendment to the FCRA passed in 2003, consumers are able to receive a free copy of their consumer report from each credit reporting agency once a year.[5]\n\nThe free report can be requested by telephone, mail, or through the government-authorized website: annualcreditreport.com\n.[6]\n\nConsumer reports obtained through annualcreditreport.com\nmake it easy to identify and dispute inaccurate information.","The FCRA regulates:","If a consumer's rights under the FCRA are violated, they can recover:","The statute of limitations requires consumers to file suit prior to the earlier of: two years after the violation is discovered; or, five years after the violation occurred.[7]\n\n","Consumer attorneys often take these cases on a contingency fee basis because the statute allows a consumer to recover attorney's fees from the offending party.","Users of the information for credit\n, insurance\n, or employment purposes (including background checks\n) have the following responsibilities under the FCRA:","Employers using consumer reports to screen job applicants or employees must follow specific procedures:","A creditor, as defined by the FCRA, is a company that furnishes information to consumer reporting agencies. Typically, these are creditors\n, with which a consumer has some sort of credit agreement (such as credit card\ncompanies, auto\nfinance companies and mortgage banking\ninstitutions).","Other examples of information furnishers are collection agencies (third-party collectors), state or municipal courts\nreporting a judgment\nof some kind, past and present employers and bonders. Lenders have an important role to play in ensuring credit reports are accurate.

Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.\n","Notice after negative information is reported\n: We have told a credit bureau about a late payment, missed payment or other default on your account. This information may be reflected in your credit report.\n","Consumer reporting agencies\n(CRAs) are entities that collect and disseminate information about consumers to be used for credit evaluation and certain other purposes, including employment. Credit bureaus, a type of consumer reporting agency, hold a consumer's credit report\nin their databases. CRAs have a number of responsibilities under FCRA, including the following:","The three big CRAs—Experian\n, TransUnion\n, and Equifax\n—do not interact with information furnishers directly as a result of consumer disputes. They use a system called E-Oscar.[11]\n\nIn some areas of the country, however, there are other credit bureaus.","In addition to the three big CRAs, the FCRA also classifies dozens of other information technology companies as \"nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies\" that produce individual consumer reports used to make credit determinations.[12]\n\nUnder Section 603 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the term \"nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency\n\" means a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis relating to:","Because these nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies sell consumer credit report files, they are required to provide annual disclosures of their report files to any consumer who requests disclosure.[13]\n\nA partial list of companies classified as nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies under FCRA includes: Telecheck\n, ChoicePoint\n, Acxiom\n, Integrated Screening Partners\n, Innovis\n, the Insurance Services Office\n, Tenant Data Services\n, LexisNexis\n, Retail Equation\n, Central Credit\n, Teletrack\n, the MIB Group\n, United Health Group\n(Ingenix Division), and Milliman\n.[14]\n\n","Although the major CRAs Experian\n, Equifax\n, and TransUnion\nare required by law to provide a central source website for consumers to request their reports, the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies are not required to provide a centralized online source for disclosure.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94de610262df3aa1b2f53b"},"content":{"contents":["Identity theft\nis the deliberate use of someone else's identity\n, usually as a method to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person's name,[1]\n\n[2]\n\nand perhaps to the other person's disadvantage or loss. The person whose identity has been assumed may suffer adverse consequences, [3]\n\nespecially if they are held responsible for the perpetrator's actions. Identity theft occurs when someone uses another's personally identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term identity theft\nwas coined in 1964.[4]\n\nSince that time, the definition of identity theft has been statutorily prescribed throughout both the U.K. and the United States as the theft of personally identifying information, generally including a person’s name, date of birth, social security number, driver’s license number, bank account or credit card numbers, PIN numbers, electronic signatures, fingerprints, passwords, or any other information that can be used to access a person’s financial resources.[5]\n\n","Determining the link between data breaches and identity theft is challenging, primarily because identity theft victims often do not know how their personal information was obtained, and identity theft is not always detectable by the individual victims, according to a report done for the FTC.[6]\n\nIdentity fraud\nis often but not necessarily the consequence of identity theft. Someone can steal or misappropriate personal information without then committing identity theft using the information about every person, such as when a major data breach\noccurs. A US Government Accountability Office study determined that \"most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft\".[7]\n\nThe report also warned that \"the full extent is unknown\". A later unpublished study by Carnegie Mellon University noted that \"Most often, the causes of identity theft is not known\", but reported that someone else concluded that \"the probability of becoming a victim to identity theft as a result of a data breach is ... around only 2%\".[8]\n\nMore recently, an association of consumer data companies noted that one of the largest data breaches ever, accounting for over four million records, resulted in only about 1,800 instances of identity theft, according to the company whose systems were breached.","An October 2010 article entitled \"Cyber Crime Made Easy\" explained the level to which hackers are using malicious software. As one security specialist named Gunter Ollmann\nsaid, \"Interested in credit card theft? There's an app for that.\" This statement summed up the ease with which these hackers are accessing all kinds of information online. The new program for infecting users' computers is called Zeus\n; and the program is so hacker friendly that even an inexperienced hacker can operate it. Although the hacking program is easy to use, that fact does not diminish the devastating effects that Zeus (or other software like Zeus) can do to a computer and the user. For example, the article stated that programs like Zeus can steal credit card information, important documents, and even documents necessary for homeland security\n. If the hacker were to gain this information, it would mean identity theft or even a possible terrorist attack.[9]\n\nThe ITAC says that about 15 million Americans are having their identity stolen, in 2012.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","","","Sources such as the non-profit\nIdentity Theft Resource Center\n[10]\n\nsub-divide identity theft into five categories:","Identity theft may be used to facilitate or fund other crimes including illegal immigration\n, terrorism\n, phishing\nand espionage\n. There are cases of identity cloning to attack payment systems, including online credit card processing and medical insurance.[11]\n\n","In this situation, the identity thief impersonates someone else in order to conceal their own true identity. Examples might be illegal immigrants, people hiding from creditors or other individuals, or those who simply want to become \"anonymous\" for personal reasons. Another example are posers\n, a label given to people who use somebody else's photos and information through social networking sites. Mostly, posers create believable stories involving friends of the real person they are imitating. Unlike identity theft used to obtain credit which usually comes to light when the debts mount, concealment may continue indefinitely without being detected, particularly if the identity thief is able to obtain false credentials in order to pass various authentication tests in everyday life.","When a criminal fraudulently identifies himself to police as another individual at the point of arrest, it is sometimes referred to as \"Criminal Identity Theft.\" In some cases criminals have previously obtained state-issued identity documents using credentials stolen from others, or have simply presented a fake ID\n. Provided the subterfuge works, charges may be placed under the victim's name, letting the criminal off the hook. Victims might only learn of such incidents by chance, for example by receiving court summons, discovering their drivers licenses are suspended when stopped for minor traffic violations, or through background checks\nperformed for employment purposes.","It can be difficult for the victim of a criminal identity theft to clear their record. The steps required to clear the victim's incorrect criminal record\ndepend in which jurisdiction the crime occurred and whether the true identity of the criminal can be determined. The victim might need to locate the original arresting officers and prove their own identity by some reliable means such as fingerprinting or DNA testing, and may need to go to a court hearing to be cleared of the charges. Obtaining an expungement\nof court records may also be required. Authorities might permanently maintain the victim's name as an alias for the criminal's true identity in their criminal records databases. One problem that victims of criminal identity theft may encounter is that various data aggregators\nmight still have the incorrect criminal records in their databases even after court and police records are corrected. Thus it is possible that a future background check will return the incorrect criminal records.[12]\n\nThis is just one example of the kinds of impact that may continue to affect the victims of identity theft for some months or even years after the crime, aside from the psychological trauma that being 'cloned' typically engenders.","A variation of identity theft which has recently become more common is synthetic identity theft\n, in which identities are completely or partially fabricated.[13]\n\nThe most common technique involves combining a real social security number\nwith a name and birthdate other than the ones associated with the number. Synthetic identity theft is more difficult to track as it doesn't show on either person's credit report directly, but may appear as an entirely new file in the credit bureau\nor as a subfile on one of the victim's credit reports. Synthetic identity theft primarily harms the creditors who unwittingly grant the fraudsters credit. Individual victims can be affected if their names become confused with the synthetic identities, or if negative information in their subfiles impacts their credit ratings.[14]\n\n","Privacy researcher Pam Dixon, founder of the World Privacy Forum, coined the term medical identity theft and released the first major report about this issue in 2006. In the report, she defined the crime for the first time and made the plight of victims public. The report's definition of the crime is that medical identity theft occurs when someone seeks medical care under the identity of another person. Insurance theft is also very common, if a thief has your insurance information and or your insurance card, they can seek medical attention posing as yourself.[15]\n\nIn addition to risks of financial harm common to all forms of identity theft, the thief's medical history may be added to the victim's medical records. Inaccurate information in the victim's records is difficult to correct and may affect future insurability or cause doctors relying on the misinformation to deliver inappropriate medical care. After the publication of the report, which contained a recommendation that consumers receive notifications of medical data breach incidents, California passed a law requiring this, and then finally HIPAA was expanded to also require medical breach notification when breaches affect 500 or more people.[16]\n\n[17]\n\nData collected and stored by hospitals and other organisations such as medical aid schemes is up to 10 times more valuable to cybercriminals than credit card information.","Child identity theft occurs when a minor's identity is used by another person for the impostor's personal gain. The impostor can be a family member, a friend, or even a stranger who targets children. The Social Security numbers of children are valued because they do not have any information associated with them. Thieves can establish lines of credit, obtain driver's licenses, or even buy a house using a child's identity. This fraud can go undetected for years, as most children do not discover the problem until years later. Child identity theft is fairly common, and studies have shown that the problem is growing. The largest study on child identity theft, as reported by Richard Power of the Carnegie Mellon\nCylab with data supplied by AllClear ID\n, found that of 40,000 children, 10.2% were victims of identity theft.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","The most common type is financial identity theft, where someone wants to gain economical benefits in someone else's name. This includes getting credits, loans, goods and services, claiming to be someone else.[18]\n\n","Identity thieves typically obtain and exploit personally identifiable information\nabout individuals, or various credentials they use to authenticate themselves, in order to impersonate them. Examples include:","The majority of identity theft victims do not realize that they are a victim until it has negatively impacted their lives. Many people do not find out that their identities have been stolen until they are contacted by financial institutions or discover suspicious activities on their bank accounts.[22]\n\nAccording to an article by Herb Weisbaum\n, everyone in the US should assume that their personal information has been compromised at one point.[22]\n\nIt is therefore of great importance to watch out for warning signs that your identity has been compromised. The following are ten indicators that someone else might be using your identity.","The acquisition of personal identifiers is made possible through serious breaches of privacy\n. For consumers, this is usually a result of them naively providing their personal information or login credentials to the identity thieves as a result of being duped but identity-related documents such as credit cards, bank statements, utility bills, checkbooks etc. may also be physically stolen from vehicles, homes, offices, and not the least letter boxes\n, or directly from victims by pickpockets and bag snatchers. Guardianship of personal identifiers by consumers is the most common intervention strategy recommended by the US Federal Trade Commission\n, Canadian Phone Busters\nand most sites that address identity theft. Such organizations offer recommendations on how individuals can prevent their information falling into the wrong hands.","Identity theft can be partially mitigated by not\nidentifying oneself unnecessarily (a form of information security control known as risk avoidance). This implies that organizations, IT systems and procedures should not demand excessive amounts of personal information or credentials for identification and authentication. Requiring, storing and processing personal identifiers (such as Social Security number\n, national identification number\n, driver's license number, credit card number, etc.) increases the risks of identity theft unless this valuable personal information is adequately secured at all times. Committing personal identifiers to memory is a sound practice that can reduce the risks of a would-be identity thief from obtaining these records. To help in remembering numbers such as social security numbers and credit card numbers, it is helpful to consider using mnemonic techniques or memory aids such as the mnemonic Major System\n.","Identity thieves sometimes impersonate dead people, using personal information obtained from death notices, gravestones and other sources to exploit delays between the death and the closure of the person's accounts, the inattentiveness of grieving families and weaknesses in the processes for credit-checking. Such crimes may continue for some time until the deceased's families or the authorities notice and react to anomalies.[26]\n\n","In recent years, commercial identity theft protection/insurance services have become available in many countries. These services purport to help protect the individual from identity theft or help detect that identity theft has occurred in exchange for a monthly or annual membership fee or premium.[27]\n\nThe services typically work either by setting fraud alerts on the individual's credit files with the three major credit bureaus or by setting up credit report monitoring\nwith the credit bureaux. While identity theft protection/insurance services have been heavily marketed, their value has been called into question.[28]\n\n","In their May 1998 testimony before the United States Senate, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) discussed the sale of Social Security numbers and other personal identifiers by credit-raters and data miners. The FTC agreed to the industry's self-regulating principles restricting access to information on credit reports.[29]\n\nAccording to the industry, the restrictions vary according to the category of customer. Credit reporting agencies gather and disclose personal and credit information to a wide business client base.","Poor stewardship of personal data by organizations, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data, can expose individuals to the risk of identity theft. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse has documented over 900 individual data breaches by US companies and government agencies since January 2005, which together have involved over 200 million total records containing sensitive personal information, many containing social security numbers.[30]\n\nPoor corporate diligence standards which can result in data breaches include:","The failure of corporate or government organizations to protect consumer privacy\n, client confidentiality\nand political privacy\nhas been criticized for facilitating the acquisition of personal identifiers by criminals.[31]\n\n","Using various types of biometric\ninformation, such as fingerprints\n, for identification and authentication has been cited as a way to thwart identity thieves, however there are technological limitations and privacy concerns associated with these methods as well.","In March 2014, after it was learned two passengers with stolen passports were on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370\nwhich went missing on March 8, 2014, it came to light that Interpol\nmaintains a database of 40 million lost and stolen travel documents from 157 countries which it makes available to governments and the public, including airlines and hotels. The Stolen and Lost Travel Documents (SLTD) database however is little used. Big News Network\nwhich is based in the UAE\n, observed that Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble\ntold a forum in Abu Dhabi\nthe previous month this was the case. \"The bad news is that, despite being incredibly cost effective and deployable to virtually anywhere in the world, only a handful of countries are systematically using SLTD to screen travelers. The result is a major gap in our global security apparatus that is left vulnerable to exploitation by criminals and terrorists,\" Noble is quoted as saying.[32]\n\n","In Australia, each state has enacted laws that deal with different aspects of identity or fraud issues. Some states have now amended relevant criminal laws to reflect crimes of identity theft, such as the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA), Crimes Amendment (Fraud, Identity and Forgery Offences) Act 2009 and also in Queensland under the Criminal Code 1899 (QLD). Other states and territories are in states of development in respect of regulatory frameworks relating to identity theft such as Western Australia in respect of Criminal Code Amendment (Identity Crime) Bill 2009.","At the Commonwealth level, under the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery \u0026amp; Related Offences) Act 2000\nwhich amended certain provisions within the Criminal Code Act 1995\n,","Between 2014 and 2015, in Australia there were 133,921 fraud and deception offences, an increase of 6% from previous year. The total cost reported by the Attorney General Department was:[33]\n\n","$27,981 per recorded incident","There are also high indirect costs associated as a direct result of an incident. For example, the total indirect costs for police recorded fraud is $5,774,081.[33]\n\n","135.1 General dishonesty\n","(3) A person is guilty of an offence if a) the person does anything with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to another person\n; and b) the other person is a Commonwealth entity. Penalty: Imprisonment for 5 years\n.","Likewise, each state has enacted their own privacy laws to prevent misuse of personal information and data. The Commonwealth Privacy Act\nis applicable only to Commonwealth and territory agencies, and to certain private sector bodies (where for example they deal with sensitive records, such as medical records, or they have more than $3 million turnover PA).","Under section 402.2 of the Criminal Code\n,\n","Everyone commits an offence who knowingly obtains or possesses another person's identity information in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference that the information is intended to be used to commit an indictable offence that includes fraud, deceit or falsehood as an element of the offence.","is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years; or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.","Under section 403 of the Criminal Code\n,\n","(1) Everyone commits an offence who fraudulently personates another person, living or dead,","(a) with intent to gain advantage for themselves or another person; (b) with intent to obtain any property or an interest in any property; (c) with intent to cause disadvantage to the person being personated or another person; or (d) with intent to avoid arrest or prosecution or to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice. is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years; or guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.","In Canada, Privacy Act\n(federal legislation) covers only federal government, agencies and crown corporations\n. Each province and territory has its own privacy law and privacy commissioners to limit the storage and use of personal data. For the private sector, the purpose of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ( 2000, c. 5 ) (known as PIPEDA) is to establish rules to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information; except for the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia where provincial laws have been deemed substantially similar.","In France, a person convicted of identity theft can be sentenced up to five years in prison and fined up to €\n75,000.[34]\n\n","Under HK Laws.

There are people who meet online, get to know each other through the free Facebook chat and exchange of messages that then leads to sharing of private information. Others get romantically involved with their online friends that they tend to give too much information such as their social security number, bank account and even personal basic information such as home address and company address.","This phenomenon lead to the creation of Senate Bill 52: Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2010.[37]\n\nSection 2 of this bill states that it recognizes the importance of communication\nand multimedia\nfor the development, exploitation and dissemination of information but violators will be punished by the law through imprisonment or a fine upwards of Php200,000, but not exceeding 1 million, or depending on the damage caused, or both (Section 7).","Sweden has had relatively few problems with identity theft. This is because only Swedish identity documents\nhave been accepted for identity verification. Stolen documents are traceable by banks and some other institutions. The banks have the duty to check the identity of people withdrawing money or getting loans. If a bank gives money to someone using an identity document reported as stolen, the bank must take the loss. Since 2008, any EU passport is valid in Sweden for identity check, and Swedish passports are valid all over the EU. This makes it harder to detect stolen documents, but still banks in Sweden must ensure that stolen documents are not accepted.","Other types of identity theft have become more common in Sweden. One common example is ordering a credit card to someone who has an unlocked letterbox and is not home in the daytime. The thief steals the letter with the credit card and then the letter with the code which typically arrives a few days later. Usage of a stolen credit card is hard in Sweden, since an identity document or a PIN code it is normally demanded. If the shop does not demand that, it must take the loss from stolen credit cards. The method of observing someone using the credit card PIN code, stealing the card or skimming\nit, and then using the card, has become more common.","Legally, Sweden is an open society. The Principle of Public Access\nsays that all information kept by public authorities must be available for anyone except in certain cases. Specifically, anyone's address, income, taxes etc. are available to anyone. This makes fraud easier (the address is restricted only for people who needs to hide).","There was until 2016 no legal ban specifically against using someone's identity, only on the indirect damage caused. To impersonate someone else for financial gain is a kind of fraud\n, which is described in the Criminal Code\n(Swedish\n: brottsbalken\n\n). To impersonate someone else to discredit someone by breaking into social media accounts and provoke, is libel\n, but that is hard to sentence someone for. A new law was introduced late 2016 which partially banned unpermitted identity usage.[38]\n\n","In the United Kingdom personal data is protected by the Data Protection Act 1998\n. The Act covers all personal data which an organization may hold, including names, birthday and anniversary dates, addresses, telephone numbers, etc.","Under English law\n(which extends to Wales\nbut not to Northern Ireland\nor Scotland\n), the deception\noffences under the Theft Act 1968\nincreasingly contend with identity theft situations. In R v Seward\n(2005) EWCA Crim 1941[39]\n\nthe defendant was acting as the \"front man\" in the use of stolen credit cards and other documents to obtain goods. He obtained goods to the value of £10,000 for others who are unlikely ever to be identified. The Court of Appeal considered sentencing policy for deception offenses involving \"identity theft\" and concluded that a prison sentence was required. Henriques J. said at para 14:\"Identity fraud is a particularly pernicious and prevalent form of dishonesty calling for, in our judgment, deterrent sentences.\"","Statistics released by CIFAS\n- The UK's Fraud Prevention Service show that there were 89,000 victims of identity theft in the UK 2010.[40]\n\nThis compared with 2009 where there were 85,000 victims.[41]\n\nMen in their 30s and 40s are the most common UK victims[42]\n\nand identity fraud now accounts for nearly half of all frauds recorded.[43]\n\n","The increase in crimes of identity theft led to the drafting of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act.[44]\n\nIn 1998, The Federal Trade Commission appeared before the United States Senate.[45]\n\nThe FTC discussed crimes which exploit consumer credit to commit loan fraud, mortgage fraud\n, lines-of-credit fraud, credit card fraud\n, commodities and services frauds. The Identity Theft Deterrence Act (2003)[ITADA] amended U.S. Code Title 18, § 1028\n(\"Fraud related to activity in connection with identification documents, authentication features, and information\"). The statute now makes the possession of any \"means of identification\" to \"knowingly transfer, possess, or use without lawful authority\" a federal crime, alongside unlawful possession of identification documents. However, for federal jurisdiction to prosecute, the crime must include an \"identification document\" that either: (a) is purportedly issued by the United States, (b) is used or intended to defraud the United States, (c) is sent through the mail, or (d) is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce. See\n18 U.S.C.\n\u0026#160;§\u0026#160;1028\n(c). Punishment can be up to 5, 15, 20, or 30 years in federal prison\n, plus fines, depending on the underlying crime per 18 U.S.C.\n\u0026#160;§\u0026#160;1028\n(b). In addition, punishments for the unlawful use of a \"means of identification\" were strengthened in § 1028A (\"Aggravated Identity Theft\"), allowing for a consecutive sentence under specific enumerated felony violations as defined in § 1028A(c)(1) through (11).[46]\n\n","The Act also provides the Federal Trade Commission\nwith authority to track the number of incidents and the dollar value of losses. Their figures relate mainly to consumer financial crimes and not the broader range of all identification-based crimes.[47]\n\n","If charges are brought by state or local law enforcement agencies, different penalties apply depending on the state.","Six Federal agencies conducted a joint task force to increase the ability to detect identity theft. Their joint recommendation on \"red flag\" guidelines is a set of requirements on financial institutions and other entities which furnish credit data to credit reporting services to develop written plans for detecting identity theft. The FTC has determined that most medical practices are considered creditors and are subject to requirements to develop a plan to prevent and respond to patient identity theft.[48]\n\nThese plans must be adopted by each organization's Board of Directors and monitored by senior executives.[49]\n\n","Identity theft complaints as a percentage of all fraud complaints decreased from 2004-2006.[50]\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission reported that fraud complaints in general were growing faster than ID theft complaints.[50]\n\nThe findings were similar in two other FTC studies done in 2003 and 2005. In 2003, 4.6 percent of the US population said they were a victim of ID theft. In 2005, that number had dropped to 3.7 percent of the population.[51]\n\n[52]\n\nThe Commission's 2003 estimate was that identity theft accounted for some $52.6 billion of losses in the preceding year alone and affected more than 9.91 million Americans;[53]\n\nthe figure comprises $47.6 billion lost by businesses and $5 billion lost by consumers.","According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics\n, in 2010, 7% of US households experienced identity theft - up from 5.5% in 2005 when the figures were first assembled, but broadly flat since 2007.[54]\n\nIn 2012, approximately 16.6 million persons, or 7% of all U.S. residents age 16 or older, reported being victims of one or more incidents of identity theft.[55]\n\n","At least two states, California\n[56]\n\nand Wisconsin\n[57]\n\nhave created an Office of Privacy Protection to assist their citizens in avoiding and recovering from identity theft.","In 2009, Indiana created an Identity Theft Unit within their Office of Attorney General to educate and assist consumers in avoiding and recovering from identity theft as well as assist law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting identity theft crimes.[58]\n\n[59]\n\n","In Massachusetts in 2009-2010, Governor Deval Patrick\nmade a commitment to balance consumer protection with the needs of small business owners. His Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation announced certain adjustments to Massachusetts' identity theft regulations that maintain protections and also allows flexibility in compliance. These updated regulations went into effect on March 1, 2010. The regulations are clear that their approach to data security is a risk-based approach important to small businesses and might not handle a lot of personal information about customers.[60]\n\n[61]\n\n","The IRS\nhas created[when?\n\n\n]\nthe IRS Identity Protection Specialized Unit to help taxpayers' who are victims of federal tax-related identity theft.[62]\n\nGenerally, the identity thief will use a stolen SSN to file a forged tax return and attempt to get a fraudulent refund early in the filing season. A taxpayer will need to fill out Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit\n\n.[63]\n\n[64]\n\n","Many states followed California's lead and enacted mandatory data breach notification laws. As a result, companies that report a data breach typically report it to all their customers.[65]\n\n","Surveys in the USA from 2003 to 2006 showed a decrease in the total number of victims and a decrease in the total value of identity fraud from US$47.6 billion in 2003 to $15.6 billion in 2006. The average fraud per person decreased from $4,789 in 2003 to $1,882 in 2006. A Microsoft report shows that this drop is due to statistical problems with the methodology, that such survey-based estimates are \"hopelessly flawed\" and exaggerate the true losses by orders of magnitude.[66]\n\n","The 2003 survey from the Identity Theft Resource Center[67]\n\nfound that:","In a widely publicized account,[68]\n\nMichelle Brown, a victim of identity fraud, testified before a U.S. Senate Committee Hearing on Identity Theft. Ms. Brown testified that: \"over a year and a half from January 1998 through July 1999, one individual impersonated me to procure over $50,000 in goods and services. Not only did she damage my credit, but she escalated her crimes to a level that I never truly expected: she engaged in drug trafficking. The crime resulted in my erroneous arrest record, a warrant out for my arrest, and eventually, a prison record when she was booked under my name as an inmate in the Chicago Federal Prison.\"","In Australia\n, identity theft was estimated to be worth between A$1billion and A$4 billion per annum in 2001.[69]\n\n","In the United Kingdom, the Home Office reported that identity fraud costs the UK economy £1.2 billion annually[70]\n\n(experts believe that the real figure could be much higher)[71]\n\nalthough privacy groups object to the validity of these numbers, arguing that they are being used by the government to push for introduction of national ID cards\n. Confusion over exactly what constitutes identity theft has led to claims that statistics may be exaggerated.[72]\n\nAn extensively reported[73]\n\n[74]\n\nstudy from Microsoft Research[75]\n\nin 2011 finds that estimates of identity theft losses contain enormous exaggerations, writing that surveys \"are so compromised and biased that no faith whatever can be placed in their findings.\""],"title":"Identity

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94de680262df3aa1b2f53d"},"content":{"contents":["The privacy laws of the United States\ndeal with several different legal\nconcepts. One is the invasion of privacy\n, a tort\nbased in common law allowing an aggrieved party to bring a lawsuit against an individual who unlawfully intrudes into his or her private affairs, discloses his or her private information, publicizes him or her in a false light, or appropriates his or her name for personal gain.[1]\n\nPublic figures\nhave less privacy, and this is an evolving area of law as it relates to the media\n.","The essence of the law derives from a right to privacy\n, defined broadly as \"the right to be let alone.\" It usually excludes personal matters or activities which may reasonably be of public interest, like those of celebrities or participants in newsworthy events. Invasion of the right to privacy can be the basis for a lawsuit for damages against the person or entity violating the right. These include the Fourth Amendment\nright to be free of unwarranted search or seizure, the First Amendment\nright to free assembly, and the Fourteenth Amendment\ndue process right, recognized by the Supreme Court\nas protecting a general right to privacy within family, marriage, motherhood, procreation, and child rearing.[2]\n\n","Attempts to improve consumer privacy protections in the US in the wake of the May-July 2017 Equifax data breach\n, which impacted 145.5 million US consumers, were blocked by Republican Party\nofficials.[3]\n\n","","","The early years in the development of privacy rights began with English common law\nwhich protected \"only the physical interference of life and property\". The Castle doctrine analogizes a person's home to his or her castle – a site that is private and should not be accessible without permission of the owner. The development of tort remedies by the common law is \"one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law\".[4]\n\nThose rights expanded to include a \"recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect.\" Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic \"right to be let alone,\" and the former definition of \"property\" would then comprise \"every form of possession – intangible, as well as tangible.\" By the late 19th century, interest in privacy grew as a result of the growth of print media, especially newspapers.[4]\n\n","Between 1850 and 1890, U.S. newspaper circulation grew by 1,000 percent—from 100 papers with 800,000 readers to 900 papers with more than 8 million readers.[4]\n\nIn addition, newspaper journalism became more sensationalized, and was termed yellow journalism\n. The growth of industrialism led to rapid advances in technology, including the handheld camera, as opposed to earlier studio cameras\n, which were much heavier and larger. In 1884, Eastman Kodak\ncompany introduced their Kodak Brownie\n, and it became a mass market\ncamera by 1901, cheap enough for the general public. This allowed people and journalists to take candid snapshots in public places for the first time.","Samuel D. Warren\nand Louis D. Brandeis\n, young partners in a new law firm, feared that this new small camera technology would be used by the \"sensationalistic press.\" Seeing this becoming a likely challenge to individual privacy rights, they wrote the \"pathbreaking\"[4]\n\nHarvard Law Review\n\narticle in 1890, \"The Right to Privacy\".[5]\n\nAccording to legal scholar Roscoe Pound\n, the article did \"nothing less than add a chapter to our law\",[6]\n\nand in 1966 legal textbook author, Harry Kalven\n, hailed it as the \"most influential law review article of all\".[4]\n\nAs recently as 2001, in the Supreme Court case of Kyllo v. United States\n\n, 533 U.S. 27 (2001), the article was cited by a majority of justices, both those concurring and those dissenting.[4]\n\n","The development of the doctrine regarding the tort of \"invasion of privacy\" was largely spurred by the Warren and Brandeis article, \"The Right to Privacy\". In it, they explain why they wrote the article in its introduction: \"Political, social, and economic changes entail the recognition of new rights, and the common law, in its eternal youth, grows to meet the demands of society\".[5]\n\nMore specifically, they also shift their focus on newspapers:","The press is overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and of decency. Gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and of the vicious, but has become a trade, which is pursued with industry as well as effrontery. To satisfy a prurient taste the details of sexual relations are spread broadcast in the columns of the daily papers....The intensity and complexity of life, attendant upon advancing civilization, have rendered necessary some retreat from the world, and man, under the refining influence of culture, has become more sensitive to publicity, so that solitude and privacy have become more essential to the individual; but modern enterprise and invention have, through invasions upon his privacy, subjected him to mental pain and distress, far greater than could be inflicted by mere bodily injury.\"[5]\n\n","They then clarify their goals: \"It is our purpose to consider whether the existing law affords a principle which can properly be invoked to protect the privacy of the individual; and, if it does, what the nature and extent of such protection is\".[5]\n\n","Warren and Brandeis write that privacy rights should protect both businesses and private individuals. They describe rights in trade secrets\nand unpublished literary materials, regardless whether those rights are invaded intentionally or unintentionally, and without regard to any value they may have. For private individuals, they try to define how to protect \"thoughts, sentiments, and emotions, expressed through the medium of writing or of the arts\". They describe such things as personal diaries and letters needing protection, and how that should be done: \"Thus, the courts, in searching for some principle upon which the publication of private letters could be enjoined, naturally came upon the ideas of a breach of confidence\n, and of an implied contract\n\". They also define this as a breach of trust, where a person has trusted that another will not publish their personal writings, photographs, or artwork, without their permission, including any \"facts relating to his private life, which he has seen fit to keep private\". And recognizing that technological advances will become more relevant, they write: \"Now that modern devices afford abundant opportunities for the perpetration of such wrongs without any participation by the injured party, the protection granted by the law must be placed upon a broader foundation\".[5]\n\n","In the United States today, \"invasion of privacy\" is a commonly used cause of action\nin legal pleadings\n. Modern tort law includes four categories of invasion of privacy:[7]\n\n","Intrusion of solitude occurs where one person intrudes upon the private affairs of another. In a famous case from 1944, author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings\nwas sued by Zelma Cason, who was portrayed as a character in Rawlings' acclaimed memoir, Cross Creek\n.[8]\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court\nheld that a cause of action for invasion of privacy was supported by the facts of the case, but in a later proceeding found that there were no actual damages.","Intrusion upon seclusion occurs when a perpetrator intentionally intrudes, physically, electronically, or otherwise, upon the private space, solitude, or seclusion of a person, or the private affairs or concerns of a person, by use of the perpetrator's physical senses or by electronic device or devices to oversee or overhear the person's private affairs, or by some other form of investigation, examination, or observation intrude upon a person's private matters if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. Hacking into someone else's computer is a type of intrusion upon privacy,[9]\n\nas is secretly viewing or recording private information by still or video camera.[10]\n\nIn determining whether intrusion has occurred, one of three main considerations may be involved: expectation of privacy\n; whether there was an intrusion, invitation, or exceedance of invitation; or deception, misrepresentation, or fraud to gain admission. Intrusion is “an information-gathering, not a publication, tort…legal wrong occurs at the time of the intrusion. No publication is necessary”.[11]\n\n","Restrictions against the invasion of privacy encompasses journalists as well:","“The First Amendment has never been construed to accord newsmen immunity from torts or crimes committed during the course of newsgathering. The First Amendment is not a license to trespass, to steal, or to intrude by electronic means into the precincts of another’s home or office”.[11]\n\n[12]\n\n","Public disclosure of private facts arises where one person reveals information which is not of public concern, and the release of which would offend a reasonable person.[13]\n\n\"Unlike libel or slander, truth is not a defense for invasion of privacy.\"[9]\n\nDisclosure of private facts includes publishing or widespread dissemination of little-known, private facts that are non-newsworthy, not part of public records, public proceedings, not of public interest, and would be offensive to a reasonable person if made public.[11]\n\n","False light is a legal\nterm that refers to a tort\nconcerning privacy\nthat is similar to the tort of defamation\n. For example, the privacy laws in the United States include a non-public person's\nright to privacy from publicity\nwhich puts them in a false light to the public\n. A non-public person's right to privacy from publicity is balanced against the First Amendment\nright of free speech\n.","False light laws\nare \"intended primarily to protect the plaintiff\n's mental\nor emotional\nwell-being\".[14]\n\nIf a publication\nof information\nis false\n, then a tort of defamation\nmight have occurred. If that communication\nis not technically\nfalse but is still misleading\n, then a tort of false light might have occurred.[14]\n\n","The specific elements of the Tort of false light vary considerably even among those jurisdictions\nwhich do recognize this tort. Generally, these elements consist of the following:","Thus in general, the doctrine of false light holds:","One who gives publicity to a matter concerning another before the public in a false light is subject to liability to the other for invasion of privacy, if (a)\u0026#160;the false light in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b)\u0026#160;the actor had knowledge of or acted in a reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.[15]\n\n","For this wrong, money damages may be recovered from the first person by the other.","At first glance, this may appear to be similar to defamation (libel and slander), but the basis for the harm is different, and the remedy is different in two respects. First, unlike libel and slander, no showing of actual harm or damage to the plaintiff is usually required in false light cases, and the court will determine the amount of damages. Second, being a violation of a Constitutional right of privacy, there may be no applicable statute of limitations in some jurisdictions specifying a time limit within which period a claim must be filed.","Consequently, although it is infrequently invoked, in some cases false light may be a more attractive cause of action for plaintiffs than libel or slander, because the burden of proof may be less onerous.","What does \"publicity\" mean? A newspaper of general circulation (or comparable breadth) or as few as 3–5 people who know the person harmed? Neither defamation nor false light has ever required everyone in society be informed by a harmful act, but the scope of \"publicity\" is variable. In some jurisdictions, publicity \"means that the matter is made public, by communicating it to the public at large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain to become one of public knowledge.\"[16]\n\n","Moreover, the standards of behavior governing employees of government institutions subject to a state or national Administrative Procedure Act (as in the United States) are often more demanding than those governing employees of private or business institutions like newspapers. A person acting in an official capacity for a government agency may find that their statements are not indemnified by the principle of agency, leaving them personally liable for any damages.","Example: If someone's reputation was portrayed in a false light during a personnel performance evaluation in a government agency or public university, one might be wronged if only a small number initially learned of it, or if adverse recommendations were made to only a few superiors (by a peer committee to department chair, dean, dean's advisory committee, provost, president, etc.). Settled cases suggest false light may not be effective in private school personnel cases,[17]\n\nbut they may be distinguishable from cases arising in public institutions.","Although privacy is often a common-law tort, most states have enacted statutes that prohibit the use of a person’s name or image if used without consent for the commercial benefit of another person.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Appropriation of name or likeness occurs when a person uses the name or likeness of another person for personal gain or commercial advantage. Action for misappropriation of right of publicity protects a person against loss caused by appropriation of personal likeness for commercial exploitation. A person's exclusive rights to control his or her name and likeness to prevent others from exploiting without permission is protected in similar manner to a trademark action with the person's likeness, rather than the trademark, being the subject of the protection.[9]\n\nAppropriation is the oldest recognized form of invasion of privacy involving the use of an individual’s name, likeness, or identity without consent for purposes such as ads, fictional works, or products.[11]\n\n","\"The same action\u0026#160;– appropriation —can violate either an individual’s right of privacy or right of publicity. Conceptually, however, the two rights differ\".[11]\n\n","Although the word \"privacy\" is actually never used in the text of the United States Constitution\n,[18]\n\nthere are Constitutional limits to the government's intrusion into individuals' right to privacy. This is true even when pursuing a public purpose such as exercising police powers or passing legislation. The Constitution, however, only protects against state actors\n. Invasions of privacy by individuals can only be remedied under previous court decisions.","The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States\nensures that \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized\".","The First Amendment\nprotects the right to free assembly, broadening privacy rights. The Ninth Amendment\ndeclares that the fact that a right is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution does not mean that the government can infringe on that right. The Supreme Court\nrecognized the Fourteenth Amendment\nas providing a substantive due process right to privacy. This was first recognized by several Supreme Court Justices in Griswold v. Connecticut\n\n, a 1965 decision protecting a married couple's rights to contraception. It was recognized again in 1973 Roe v. Wade\n\n, which invoked the right to privacy to protect a woman's right to an abortion, and in the 2003 with Lawrence v. Texas\n\n, which invoked the right to privacy regarding the sexual practices of same-sex couples.","On August 22, 1972 the Alaska Right of Privacy Amendment, Amendment 3, was approved with 86% of the vote in support of the legislatively referred constitutional amendment.[19]\n\nArticle I, Section 22 of Alaska's constitution states, \"The right of the people to privacy is recognized and shall not be infringed. The legislature shall implement this section.\"[20]\n\n","Article 1, §1 of the California Constitution\narticulates privacy as an inalienable right\n.","CA SB 1386 expands on privacy law and guarantees that if a company exposes a Californian's sensitive information this exposure must be reported to the citizen. This law has inspired many states to come up with similar measures.[21]\n\n","California's \"Shine the Light\" law\n(SB 27, CA Civil Code § 1798.83), operative on January 1, 2005, outlines specific rules regarding how and when a business must disclose use of a customer's personal information\nand imposes civil damages for violation of the law.","California's Reader Privacy Act was passed into law in 2011.[22]\n\nThe law prohibits a commercial provider of a book service, as defined, from disclosing, or being compelled to disclose, any personal information relating to a user of the book service, subject to certain exceptions. The bill would require a provider to disclose personal information of a user only if a court order has been issued, as specified, and certain other conditions have been satisfied. The bill would impose civil penalties on a provider of a book service for knowingly disclosing a user's personal information to a government entity in violation of these provisions. This law is applicable to electronic books in addition to print books.[23]\n\n","Article I, §23 of the Florida Constitution\nstates that \"Every natural person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into the person’s private life except as otherwise provided herein. This section shall not be construed to limit the public’s right of access to public records and meetings as provided by law.\"[24]\n\n","Article 2, §10 of the Montana Constitution\nstates that \"The right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest\".[25]\n\n"],"title":"Privacy laws of the

Richard \"Rick\" Grodsky, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Washington University\n. Interface Technology provided interactive voice response systems. Bill Canfield joined the company in 1986 as President and CEO and added the title of Chairman in 1988.[6]\n\nTALX went public listing on the NASDAQ in an IPO in 1996 and offered 2,000,000 shares at $9 per share for a total offer amount of $18,000,000. TALX Corp. At the time of the IPO, TALX designed and implemented interactive communication solutions using computer telephony to integrate technologies such as interactive voice response, facsimile, e-mail, Internet and corporate Intranet. TALX's interactive communication solutions enabled an organization's employees, customers, vendors and business partners to access, input and update information stored in databases\nwithout human assistance. TALX also provided a branded employment and income verification service, The Work Number for Everyone, that a provided automated access to employment and salary records of large employers for purposes of loan and other credit approvals.","The events of September 11, 2001\ncaused TALX to shift its focus toward configurable data solutions and a recurring revenue model and away from custom on-premises software solutions. The employment and income verification service, The Work Number, as it was later became known, became the revenue and profit growth engine for the company. All future acquisitions and organic innovations were done to strengthen the employment and income verification business unit. March 2002 TALX Corporation acquired the two largest human resource outsourcing\ncompanies that specialized in unemployment cost management and related human resource\napplications, The Frick Company, the second largest provider headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, and the largest provider of unemployment cost management business, Gates McDonald, a subsidiary of Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.[7]\n\nTALX sold its e-Choice Benefits Enrollment Services business to Workscape in April 2003 to further focus on its core business of payroll-centric services with more standardized delivery platforms.[8]\n\n","During the period of 2002 and 2005, TALX increased its dominance in unemployment cost management services through acquisitions of Johnson \u0026amp; Associates LLC, TBT Enterprises Inc., UI Advantage Inc., Jon-Jay Associates Inc., Employers Unity Inc. and parts of Sheakley-Uniservice Inc. These acquisitions and the organic growth of The Work Number made TALX the leader in employment and income verification and unemployment cost management services in the United States.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nTALX also added or created a number of other payroll-centric Human Resource related employer services including W-2 Management, I-9 Management, Tax Credit and Incentive Management, and Online Paperless Pay. TALX also successfully partnered with ADP, Ceridian, Aon-Hewitt and other payroll\nand benefit providers to package customized suites of services under several alliance banners.","In 2007, TALX was acquired by Equifax, one of the big three credit reporting agencies, in a transaction valued at $1.4 billion.[9]\n\nAs of 2010, integration was completed and TALX now officially operates as a division of Equifax.","In October 2012, Equifax\nchanged the name of the TALX business unit to Equifax Workforce Solutions to reflect the organization's commitment to leveraging its extensive workforce data with the analytics resources of Equifax.[10]\n\n","TALX disclosed in its July 2002 10-K filing that the Securities and Exchange Commission\nwas conducting an investigation into its August 2001 secondary offering of common stock and second fiscal quarter 2001 financial results. TALX stated that they were cooperating fully with the investigation, and had voluntarily produced documents requested by the Commission and have made their employees available for interviews or testimony upon request. TALX stated that they believed that there is no basis for any action by the Commission.[11]\n\n","TALX reported in August 2004 that it has reached an agreement in principle with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle its ongoing investigation of the company's accounting of certain items, which was the subject of the company's restatements of its 2001 and 2002 financial statements. Under the agreement in principle, the company would pay a fine of $2.5 million. Separately, William W. Canfield, the company's president and chief executive officer, reached an agreement in principle with the SEC staff to settle its ongoing investigation against him in a related matter.[12]\n\n","March 2005 TALX announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accepted the previously announced offer of settlement submitted by TALX to resolve the SEC's investigation into its accounting for certain items. All financial statements in question have been previously restated to address the issues raised by the SEC. TALX agreed, without admitting or denying any liability, not to violate certain provisions of the Federal securities laws in the future. TALX also agreed to pay one dollar in disgorgement and $2.5 million in civil penalties. These amounts were paid into escrow by TALX in December 2004 and had been previously reflected in the company's financial statements. The SEC also accepted the offer of settlement submitted by William W. Canfield, TALX's president and chief executive officer, to resolve charges stemming from the same accounting issues. Canfield agreed, without admitting or denying any liability, not to violate certain provisions of the Federal securities laws in the future. He also agreed to pay $859,999 in disgorgement and $100,000 in civil penalties.[13]\n\n","The SEC filed fraud charges March 2005 against TALX Corp.'s former chief financial officer. The SEC alleged that Craig N. Cohen, who resigned in January 2004, violated antifraud and other federal securities laws by causing TALX to meet its 2001 financial target through fraudulent accounting practices. As a result, TALX overstated its 2001 income by about $2.1 million, or 65 percent, which inflated its stock price. Cohen then sold TALX shares. He is also accused of making misleading statements to auditors. The SEC sought a permanent injunction against Cohen, an officer and director bar and civil penalties. Cohen had served as chief financial officer from January 1994 to May 2003, and was vice president of application services and software from May 1999 to May 2003. He resigned at the same time TALX said it would restate its earnings for the fiscal years 1999 to 2003 to correct errors in the way it accounted for revenue. April 2007 the US District Court dismissed six of the seven counts against Cohen. The Court found Cohen guilty of the allegation of insufficient internal controls. The Court stated that there was evidence that Cohen knew he was falsely recording two projects as bill-and-hold transactions. The Court imposed a civil penalty against Cohen in the amount of $5,000.","June 2006 TALX announced that it was voluntarily responding to an initial inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission\nto assess whether TALX acquisitions in the unemployment compensation and Work Number businesses had significantly reduced competition.[14]\n\nTALX believed it has complied with applicable regulatory filing requirements and intends to cooperate with the inquiry.[15]\n\n","In April 2010, The New York Times\npublished an article about TALX.[1]\n\nIn short, TALX was accused of contesting unemployment benefits claims regardless of their merit in an effort to reduce the funds their clients — the employers — would have to pay to state unemployment insurance pools. The article pointed out that some unemployed persons were denied benefits as a result of TALX's actions.[1]\n\n"],"title":"Equifax Workforce Solutions","rels":["/wiki/The_Work_Number","/wiki/Equifax_Workforce_Solutions","/wiki/Equifax_Workforce_Solutions"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Talx"}

Current, and presumably, former employees can log on to The Work Number at any time.\nEmployees cannot control access to their records by any entity or person which knows their social security number.\nIf the employee wishes for a requestor to see his or her salary history, the employee logs on and obtains a 6-digit code, which he or she passes on to the requestor. Without that particular 6-digit code, the requestor is not allowed to view salary of the employee.\nEquifax advertises and sells some data to third parties.

Some employers feel this reduces the risk of legal liability over the subjective\ncontent of personal references\n.\nSimilarly, if an employee is concerned that a supervisor might share unfavorable information or be unwilling to verify employment, The Work Number provides some protection from this, as the system only reports objective data.

Requestors can choose a \"pay per use\" plan or can select a package which includes a certain number of verifications per month.[17]\n\n\nBecause a fee (up to $39.00 per verification) is required, this increases the financial cost of verifying an individual's employment.

In typical organizations, the cost of a verification of employment is borne completely by the employer and the actual cost of service is absorbed into the human resource department budget. In organizations using The Work Number, the cost is borne by the requestor of verification, who purchases either a single verification or a package of multiple verifications from TALX.","","","The Work Number collects weekly salary information, which is as up to date as the last pay period and can go back many years. It also collects length of employment, job titles, \"location information\", and \"other kinds of human resources-related information, such as health care provider, whether someone has dental insurance and if they’ve ever filed an unemployment claim.\"[11]\n\n","The service reduces the amount of time required for Human Resource departments to respond to employment verification requests. If Human Resource departments manage a large number of employees, such as universities, seasonal employers, etc. the amount of time savings and cost savings could be considerable.","Employees of a company or organization using The Work Number's services receive an account that is set up for them on the website. Current, and presumably, former employees can log on to The Work Number at any time.","Employees cannot control access to their records by any entity or person which knows their social security number.","If the employee wishes for a requestor to see his or her salary history, the employee logs on and obtains a 6-digit code, which he or she passes on to the requestor. Without that particular 6-digit code, the requestor is not allowed to view salary of the employee.","Equifax advertises and sells some data to third parties. Companies including \"mortgage, auto and other financial services credit grantors\" may request pay rate information similar to a credit report. Also, \"debt/collection agencies may request employment information\" to verify someone's place of employment.[11]\n\n","Additionally, as soon as the requester receives permission from an applicant to access the record, and the fee is paid (if required), it is instantly available.","The system reports factual information only, such as length of employment and job title. Some employers feel this reduces the risk of legal liability over the subjective\ncontent of personal references\n.","Similarly, if an employee is concerned that a supervisor might share unfavorable information or be unwilling to verify employment, The Work Number provides some protection from this, as the system only reports objective data. It does not include performance reviews\n.","The Work Number, if set up for this service by the employer, may provide duplicate copies of W-2 forms\nthrough the employee's online portal.","The Work Number generally charges for verification data. However, fees are waived for Federal, State, or County Social Service Departments, who are providing benefits such as the Food Stamp program or TANF to their low-income/welfare applicants. The reports are sent by fax\nand may take a few days to be sent. Certain expedited services or advanced services may have fees attached.[12]\n\n","To qualify for reduced or waived fees, the agency must register with The Work Number using an official fax number. Agencies that can take advantage of this service include eligibility programs, public housing, child support enforcement, and other public assistance needs. A \"batch service\" for multiple requests is also available.","In January 2013, The Work Number was criticized for selling access to people's ostensibly private data, especially salary data, to third parties, without the informed consent\nof the subject.[13]\n\n[14]\n\nOrganisations affected included Columbia University\n, and third parties included debt collection\ncompanies.[13]\n\n[14]\n\n","The director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse stated, \"I think [this] is something that would be offensive to many people. One typically considers salary information to be shared by your employer just with IRS\n.\"[13]\n\n","On 8 October 2017, Brian Krebs\nreported that The Work Number exposed the salary histories for employees of tens of thousands of U.S. companies to anyone in possession of the employee's Social Security number and date of birth.[15]\n\n[16]\n\nFor roughly half the U.S. population, both of the latter pieces of data are known to be in possession of criminals, following Equifax's May-July 2017 security breach\n.[15]\n\n[16]\n\n","Recently, internet security issues at sites that contain \"sensitive\" information has become a big business for hackers\n. Questions regarding the safety of various websites that offer services (such as The Work Number) that contains this information may be compromised by hackers (and may be a future target for hackers) and a problem for internet security officials. Call center is located in Costa Rica and requires Social Security Number adding more risk to identity theft.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","The Work Number charges a fee to the requesting party for each Employment Verification. Requestors can choose a \"pay per use\" plan or can select a package which includes a certain number of verifications per month.[17]\n\n","Because a fee (up to $39.00 per verification) is required, this increases the financial cost of verifying an individual's employment. There is a risk this cost could be passed on to the applicant.","Some organizations are making use of The Work Number mandatory as the only way for employees or verifiers to receive information about a staffer's employment.

The award was made on the grounds that it took her six years to get TransUnion to remove incorrect information in her credit report.[17]\n\n","In 2006, after spending two years trying to correct erroneous credit information that resulted from being a victim of identity theft, a fraud victim named Sloan filed suit against all three of the USA's largest credit agencies.

White New Idea had a large manufacturing plant operating in Coldwater, Ohio\n, USA.","Also in 1993, AGCO purchased the North American\ndistribution rights to Massey Ferguson\n, a worldwide agricultural equipment company. In 1994, they purchased McConnell Tractors,[3]\n\nmanufacturer of the large articulated Massey Ferguson tractors. AGCO developed the Agcostar line of articulated tractors. Later in 1994, the Black Machine line of planters was purchased.","1995 saw the purchase of the AgEquipment Group,[6]\n\nwhich manufactured tillage equipment and loaders under the Glenco, Tye and Farmhand brands. In 1996, acquisitions went international with the purchase of Iochpe-Maxion\nin Brazil\n.[3]\n\nThis was the Brazilian company that had rights to the Massey Ferguson brand and manufacturing in the region, as well as the Maxion\nbrand of industrial equipment.

An Indian trail, called Old Peachtree Road\nby the settlers, was extended through the area during the War of 1812\nto connect Fort Peachtree in present-day Atlanta\nwith Fort Daniel near present-day Dacula\n. When Gwinnett County was established in 1818, white settlement of the area accelerated.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Cotton merchant Evan Howell constructed a road connecting his cotton gin\nat the Chattahoochee River\nwith Old Peachtree Road, creating Howell's Cross Roads. The settlement later became known as \"Howell's Crossing\". Howell was the grandfather of Atlanta Mayor Evan P. Howell\nand great-grandfather of Atlanta Constitution\n\npublisher Clark Howell\n. His descendants continue to live in the area, but only Howell Ferry Road in Duluth bears the name.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Howell's Crossing was renamed \"Duluth\" in 1871 after Congress funded a north-south railroad line into the community. It was named after the city of Duluth, Minnesota\n. The Midwestern city had gotten its own railroad connection not long before, which had prompted Rep. J. Proctor Knott, a Kentucky\nDemocrat, to make a speech in Congress mocking the project as wasteful. That speech drew national attention. According to contemporary reports, Evan P. Howell himself jokingly suggested the name change in a speech about the arrival of railroad service in the Georgia town. (Duluth, Minnesota, is named for Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut\n(1636–1710), a French captain and explorer of the upper Midwest, who negotiated peace between the Chippewa\nand the Sioux\nnation.)[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","The railroad encouraged the growth of Duluth's economy. A schoolhouse was built in 1871 on the site of what is now Coleman Middle School (formerly Duluth Middle School and Duluth Elementary School). The first Methodist\nchurch was organized in 1871, and the first Baptist\ncongregation formed in 1886. Both churches continue today at new locations along State Route 120. The Bank of Duluth was charted in 1904, followed by the Farmers and Merchants Bank in 1911. Neither survived the Great Depression\n.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","In 1922, Duluth elected Georgia's first female mayor, Alice Harrell Strickland.[9]\n\n[10]\n\nShe donated 1-acre (4,000\u0026#160;m2\n) of land for a \"community forest\" and began efforts to conserve land for public recreation.","Duluth grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, along with the rest of Gwinnett County. Georgia Governor George Busbee\nbecame a resident of Duluth in 1983 after leaving office, moving to the Sweet Bottom Plantation subdivision developed by Scott Hudgens. A major revitalization of the Duluth downtown area was undertaken in the early 21st century. Development along Sugarloaf Parkway has continued with construction of the Gwinnett Arena near the Gwinnett Convention Center.","In much of the 20th century, when Gwinnett County was still rural, Duluth was known in the area as being one of the few small towns with its own hospital, Joan Glancy Memorial Hospital. Consequently, many older residents of the area who call other towns home were actually born in Duluth. Joan Glancy was replaced with Gwinnett Medical Center\n- Duluth in 2006. The site of the old Joan Glancy hospital is now GMC's Glancy Campus, home to the Glancy Rehabilitation Center, the Duluth location of GMC's Diabetes \u0026amp; Nutrition Education Center and the Duluth location of GMC's Center for Sleep Disorders.","The city made national headlines twice in 2005. In March, Fulton County\nCourthouse shooting suspect Brian Nichols\nwas captured in a Duluth apartment after holding a woman hostage. In April, local resident Jennifer Wilbanks\nwas reported missing a few days before her planned wedding to John Mason. She was found a few days later in Albuquerque, New Mexico\n, where she admitted to having lied about being kidnapped\n.","Duluth is located in the northeastern section of the Atlanta metropolitan area\n.

Shankar[1]\n\n[2]\n\n","American Megatrends Incorporated\n(AMI\n) is an American hardware\nand software\ncompany, specializing in PC\nhardware and firmware\n. The company was founded in 1985 by Pat Sarma and Subramonian Shankar,[3]\n\nwho was chairman and president as of 2011[update]\n\n.[1]\n\nIt is headquartered in Building 200 at 5555 Oakbrook Parkway in Gwinnett County\n, Georgia\n, United States\n, near the city of Norcross\n.[4]\n\n[5]\n\n","The company started as a manufacturer of complete motherboards\n, positioning itself in the high-end segment. Its first customer was PCs Ltd,[3]\n\nlater known as Dell\nComputers,[6]\n\nmaking one of the first Intel 80386\ndesigns.","As hardware activity moved progressively to Taiwan\n-based original design manufacturers\n,[7]\n\nAMI continued to develop BIOS firmware for major motherboard manufacturers. The company produced BIOS software for motherboards (1986), server motherboards (1992), storage controllers\n(1995) and remote-management cards (1998).","In 1993 AMI produced MegaRAID, a storage controller card\nwhich major OEMs\n(including HP and Dell) adopted. AMI sold its RAID-division assets to LSI Logic\n[3]\n\nin 2001.[8]\n\n","As of 2011[update]\n\nAMI continued to focus on OEM business and technology. Its product line includes AMIBIOS\n(a BIOS\n), Aptio (a successor to AMIBIOS8 based on the UEFI\nstandard), diagnostic software, remote-access firmware, motherboards, SGPIO\nbackplane controllers, driver/firmware development, service processors\n, iNAS and SAN storage systems for SMBs\n, and \"solutions\" for the Android\noperating system.[3]\n\n[need quotation to verify\n\n\n]\n","","","AMIBIOS (also written as AMI BIOS) is the IBM PC\n-compatible BIOS\ndeveloped and sold by American Megatrends since 1986. As of 1994[update]\n\n, the company claimed that 75% of PC clones\nused the AMIBIOS.[11]\n\nIt is used on motherboards\nmade by AMI and by other companies.","\nAmerican Megatrends has a strict OEM business model for AMIBIOS: it sells source code to motherboard manufacturers or customizes AMIBIOS for each OEM individually, whichever business model they require. AMI does not sell to end users, and itself produces no end-user documentation or technical support for its BIOS firmware, leaving that to licensees. However, the company published two books on its BIOS in 1993 and 1994, (listed in further reading\n), written by its engineers.[12]\n\n","During powerup, the BIOS firmware displays an ID string in the lower-left-hand corner of the screen. This ID string comprises various pieces of information about the firmware, including when it was compiled, what configuration options were selected, the OEM license code, and the targeted chipset and motherboard. There are 3 ID string formats, the first for older AMIBIOS, and the second and third for the newer AMI Hi-Flex (\"high flexibility\") BIOS. These latter are displayed when the Insert key is pressed during power-on self-test.[12]\n\n","The original AMI BIOS did not encrypt the machine startup password, which it stored in non-volatile RAM. Therefore, any utility capable of reading a PC's NVRAM was able to read and to alter the password. The AMI WinBIOS encrypts the stored password, using a simple substitution cipher\n.[13]\n\n","By pressing the Delete key\nduring power-on self-test when a prompt is displayed, the BIOS setup utility program is invoked. Some earlier AMIBIOS versions also included a cut-down version of the AMIDIAG utility that AMI also sold separately, but most later AMI BIOSes do not include this program as the BIOS DMI\nalready incorporates detailed diagnostics.[12]\n\n","AMIBIOS is only sold through distributors, not directly to end users. Firmware upgrades and replacements are only available from AMI for its own motherboards. Upgrades and replacements for AMIBIOS customized for a motherboard are only available from the manufacturer or from eSupport.","AMI supplies both DOS and Win32\nfirmware upgrade utilities for its own motherboards. eSupport only supplies a Win32 upgrade utility.[12]\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\n","AMIDiag is a family of PC diagnostic utilities sold to OEMs\nonly. The AMIDiag Suite was introduced in 1991 and made available for MS-DOS\n, Microsoft Windows\nand Unified Extensible Firmware Interface\n(UEFI\n) platforms. It includes both the Windows and DOS PC diagnostics programs. Later versions of AMIDiag support UEFI, which allows diagnostics to be performed directly on the hardware components, without having to use operating system drivers or facilities.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","The StorTrends\nfamily of network-based backup and storage management software and hardware includes several NAS and iSCSI-based SAN servers with 4, 12, or 16 drive bays.","AMI couples off-the-shelf hardware with the StorTrends iTX storage management firmware platform. StorTrends offers synchronous, asynchronous and snap-assisted replication, thin provisioning\n, high-availability grouping and advanced caching.","Reliability and performance is the key for any storage server. StorTrends iTX 2.8 is designed to support Storage Bridge Bay specification that provide Auto-Failover\ncapability to ensure that any interruption is handled without affecting data. It supports High-availability cluster\n, redundancy, scalability, replication, disaster recovery and multiple site backups.[16]\n\n[17]\n\n","DuOS-M\nis commercial software developed by American Megatrends for Intel\nx86\n-based computers[18]\n\nusing the Microsoft\nWindows\noperating system\nto provide a \"dual operating system\" environment in which the user can simultaneously deploy the Android\noperating system in tandem with Microsoft Windows.","Because DuOS-M has capability to run both Windows and Android operating systems at the same time, the user can switch[19]\n\nbetween the two operating systems without having to dual boot\nor suspend operation of one operating system in order to utilize the other.","DuOS-M supports key hardware peripherals\n[20]\n\nin Windows including cameras, audio, microphone and sensors such as ambient light sensor, accelerometer\n, gyrometer\n, compass\nand orientation sensors. It also supports various screen sizes, resolutions, and screen orientation (portrait and landscape) along with 3D acceleration and HD video playback.","The first version of DuOS-M was released in June 2014. The software is available for download for a free 30-day trial,[21]\n\nand is available for purchase for a complete license.","On November 13, 1993, a number of PCs that used the AMIBIOS firmware started at boot-up to play the tune to Happy Birthday repeatedly while halting the computer until a key was pressed.[22]\n\nThe problem was resolved with a Trojan\n-free firmware upgrade from most manufacturers.","The AMI WinBIOS was a 1994 update to AMIBIOS, with a graphical user interface\nsetup screen that mimicked the appearance of Windows 3.1 and supported mouse\nnavigation, unusual at the time. WinBIOS was viewed favourably by Anand Lal Shimpi at AnandTech\n,[23]\n\nbut described by Thomas Pabst at Tom's Hardware as a \"big disappointment\", in part because of problems with distributing IRQ signals to every PCI and ISA expansion slot.[24]\n\n","In July 2008 Linux developers discovered issues with ACPI tables on certain AMIBIOS BIOSes supplied by Foxconn, ASUS, and MSI. The problem is related to the ACPI _OSI method, which is used by ACPI to determine the OS version (in case an ACPI patch only applies to one specific OS). In some cases, the OSI method caused problems on Linux systems, skipping code that was only executed on Windows systems. Foxconn and AMI worked together to develop a solution, which was included in later revisions of AMIBIOS. The issue affected motherboards with Intel Socket 775. Actual system behavior differed based on BIOS version, system hardware and Linux distribution\n.[25]\n\n","American Megatrends Inc. (AMI) was founded in 1985 by Subramonian Shankar and Pat Sarma with funds from a previous consulting venture, Access Methods Inc. (also AMI). Access Methods was a company run by Pat Sarma and his partner[who?\n\n\n]\n. After Access Methods successfully launched the AMIBIOS, there were legal issues among the owners of the company, resulting in Sarma buying out his partners. Access Methods still owned the rights to the AMIBIOS. Sarma had already started a company called Quintessential Consultants Inc. (QCI), and later set up an equal partnership with Shankar.","By this time the AMIBIOS had become established and there was a need to keep the initials AMI.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94de840262df3aa1b2f545"},"content":{"contents":["Sandy Springs\nis a city in northern Fulton County\n, Georgia\n, United States, and part of the Atlanta metropolitan area\n. As of the 2010 census\n, Sandy Springs had a population of 93,853,[8]\n\nand as of 2014 the estimated population was 101,908.[9]\n\n","","","In 1842, the Austin-Johnson House was erected on what is now Johnson Ferry Road. It is the oldest house in Sandy Springs.[10]\n\nIn 1851, Wilson Spruill donated 5 acres (2.0\u0026#160;ha) of land for the founding of the Sandy Springs United Methodist Church\n, near the natural spring for which the city is named. In 1905, the Hammond School was built at Johnson Ferry\nRoad and Mt. Vernon Highway, across the street from the church.","In 1950, the state legislature blocked Atlanta from annexing the community, which remained rural until the Interstate Highway System\nwas authorized by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. In 1959, after a fire at Hammond Elementary School, Atlanta Mayor\nWilliam Hartsfield\nurged residents to support annexation so that the area would have better firefighting\nprotection. Community opposition killed the proposal. In the early 1960s, Georgia 400\nand Interstate 285\nwere constructed, connecting Sandy Springs to metro Atlanta\nand initiating a housing boom that brought new residents and major land development\n. In 1966, annexation by Atlanta was defeated in a referendum, with two-thirds voting against.","Debate over incorporation\nbegan in the 1970s when the city of Atlanta attempted to use a state law to force annexation\nof Sandy Springs. The attempt failed when the Supreme Court of Georgia\nruled that the law was unconstitutional\n. In response, the Committee for Sandy Springs was formed in 1975. In every legislative session, state legislators representing the area introduced a bill\nin the Georgia General Assembly\nto authorize a referendum\non incorporation. Legislators representing Atlanta and southwestern Fulton County, who feared tax revenue that would be lost from incorporation, blocked the bills using the procedural requirement that all local legislation\nbe approved first by a delegation of representatives from the affected area. In 1989, a push was made for Sandy Springs to join neighboring Chattahoochee Plantation\nin Cobb County\n. This move was blocked by Speaker of the House\nTom Murphy\n.","On January 16, 1997, Eric Rudolph\nbombed an abortion clinic in Sandy Springs.","When the Republican Party\ngained a majority in both houses of the General Assembly\nin 2005, the procedural rules previously used to prevent a vote by the full chamber were changed so that the bill was handled as a state bill and not as a local bill. The assembly also repealed the requirement that new cities must be at least 3 miles (4.8\u0026#160;km) from existing cities, because the new city limits border both Roswell\nand Atlanta. The bill allowing for a referendum on incorporation was introduced and passed as HB 37.[11]\n\nThe referendum initiative was approved by the Assembly and signed by Governor\nSonny Perdue\n.","The referendum was held on June 21, 2005, and residents voted 94% to 6% in favor of incorporation. Many residents expressed displeasure with county services, claiming, based upon financial information provided by the county, that the county was redistributing revenues to fund services in less financially stable areas of the county, ignoring local opposition to rezoning\n, and allowing excessive development. Many residents of unincorporated and less-developed south Fulton County strongly opposed incorporation, fearing the loss of tax revenues which fund county services. County residents outside Sandy Springs were not allowed to vote on the matter. Efforts such as requesting the U.S. Justice Department\nto reject the plan were unsuccessful.","A mayor\nand six city council\nmembers were elected in early November 2005, with Eva Galambos, who had initiated and led the charge for incorporation, elected mayor by a wide margin. Formal incorporation occurred on December 1, making Sandy Springs the third-largest city ever to incorporate in the U.S.[1]\n\nThe city's police force and fire department began service in 2006.

A small panhandle\nin the northeast extends between the Chattahoochee River to the north and Dunwoody to the south, ending in a very small border with Peachtree Corners\nin Gwinnett County\n.","Sandy Springs has a humid subtropical climate\n(Köppen climate classification\nCfa\n). During January and February 2014, Sandy Springs and Atlanta experienced an ice storm which gained national attention due to the huge traffic jams all over interstates such as 285, 75, and GA 400.

The western intersection has been reconfigured so that traffic to and from Johnson Ferry Road − which carries heavy loads of Cobb County commuters across the Chattahoochee River at rush hour\n− now flows directly with Abernathy to and from the northwest. Additionally, the Roswell Road bridge over I-285 has been widened to add a turn lane in each direction. There had previously been talk of a tunnel under the freeway\nto bypass the highway interchange\naltogether, however this proved to be much too expensive. Another state project is the addition of a half-diamond interchange\nto Georgia 400 on the north side of Hammond Drive, allowing southbound traffic to exit and northbound traffic to enter the highway. (Ramps on the south side were not possible due to the proximity of the 400/285 interchange.)","The city's public works\ndepartment has made significant improvements in the conditions of roads and traffic signals since incorporation in December 2005.

If it had received government and regulatory approval, AT\u0026amp;T would have had more than 130 million subscribers.[6]\n\nHowever, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission, and AT\u0026amp;T Mobility's competitors (such as Sprint Corporation\n) opposed the move on the grounds that it would substantially reduce competition in the cellular network\nmarket. In December 2011, in the face of both governmental and widespread consumer opposition, AT\u0026amp;T withdrew its offer to complete the merger.[7]\n\n","","","Among these services that AT\u0026amp;T aggressively promotes is its Rollover Minutes service, which allows customers to keep unused minutes from month to month on a twelve-month rolling cycle on its popular nationwide plans. Beginning in July 2007, AT\u0026amp;T allows its AT\u0026amp;T Unity\nplan users to have Rollover, a service which was exclusive to the Nation plans. AT\u0026amp;T also launched video share in 2007, in which a mobile caller can stream live video from one phone to another over the 3G\nnetwork with video share capable phones. This allows one mobile phone user to view video from another user's camera through the mobile phone in real time. AT\u0026amp;T also had A-list, similar to former competitor Alltel\n's program launched on April 20, 2006 branded \"My Circle.\" AT\u0026amp;T rolled out the A-list program on September 20, 2009. Customers with individual Nation plans of $59.99 or higher could use A-List with Rollover to select up to five domestic phone numbers to call anytime—including landlines and wireless numbers on any network—without using any of the minutes in their plan. FamilyTalk customers with plans of $89.99 or more could select up to ten numbers which any person in the FamilyTalk plan can call as much as they want.[8]\n\nEffective September 1, 2011, the A-List feature is no longer available to new consumer and IRU customers. Existing customers who had A-List on their account prior to September 1, 2011, are able to keep the feature as long as they stay on a qualifying rate plan. As of October 25, 2013 AT\u0026amp;T no longer offers Nation Plans or Family Talk Plans to its new customers. New customers are now required to have one of AT\u0026amp;T Mobile Share Value plans which include unlimited Talk, Text and a shareable bucket of data start at $45 for a smartphone. As of January 8, 2016 AT\u0026amp;T no longer offers 2 year contracts for subsidized smart phones to its consumer customers. Customers who currently have 2 year contracts are grandfathered, until they upgrade to a new device they will have to choose from AT\u0026amp;T's NEXT installment plans for smartphones.[9]\n\nAT\u0026amp;T has also reintroduced unlimited data plans for its customers who also have either AT\u0026amp;T U-verse or AT\u0026amp;T's newly acquired DirecTV. Unlimited data plans may be speed throttled after 22 GB of data have been used.[10]\n\nWith the inclusion of these new plans AT\u0026amp;T has also introduced a free roaming in Mexico feature for its postpaid customers.[11]\n\n","Within AT\u0026amp;T's 21-state landline footprint, other AT\u0026amp;T services are offered at the AT\u0026amp;T retail stores, including signing up for home phone, internet, and U-verse\n. AT\u0026amp;T stores outside of this footprint (and from 2014 Connecticut\n) only offered wireless services and accessories until AT\u0026amp;T finalized its purchase of DirecTV\nin 2015, after which all AT\u0026amp;T company-owned stores nationwide started offering DirecTV alongside wireless service.","A large number of AT\u0026amp;T Mobility employees are unionized, belonging to the Communications Workers of America\n.

However, despite that status, the user community has been critical of the reluctance of AT\u0026amp;T to release updates for their phones, often leaving AT\u0026amp;T Wireless customers far behind those on other carriers with respect to the release of Windows Phone on their devices.","In 2011, HTC released an updated version of the HTC HD7 as the HTC HD7S. It has a 5-megapixel camera with dual LED flash, a 4.3-inch screen and HTC Hub, a graphical user interface bearing a slight similarity to HTC Sense\n. HTC also released the HTC Titan\nin 2011, with a 4.7-inch Super-LCD screen. Similarly in 2011, the Samsung Focus S was added as an updated Focus, and the Focus Flash was added as an entry-level device.","In 2012, AT\u0026amp;T added the HTC Titan II and Nokia Lumia 900 as the first two LTE Windows Phones available in the United States. Shortly thereafter, the Samsung Focus 2 was made available.","As of August 14, 2012, AT\u0026amp;T Wireless was offering five Windows Phone devices for purchase on their web site: the Lumia 900, Focus Flash, 2, and S, and HTC Titan II.","In a BBDO\ncampaign for 4G and 4G LTE started in November 2012, Beck Bennett\ninterviewed children in commercials directed by Jorma Taccone\n, with the slogan \"It's not complicated.\" The children were asked whether fast or slow is better, or whether two is better than one.[69]\n\n[70]\n\n[71]\n\nTaccone said \"The spots are 'guided' improv\", meaning the children were allowed to be natural until others had to step in and help.[70]\n\n","AT\u0026amp;T Mobility sells a variety of wireless services, including individual plans, family plans, and GoPhone\n(prepaid) plans.","In 2014, AT\u0026amp;T introduced its Mobile Share Value plans. These plans included Unlimited Voice and Texting access, while data usage was on a tier-based structure with various overage rates.","These were succeeded by the Mobile Share Advantage plans in 2016, where instead of overage charges, were 2G data speeds are enacted (also known as throttling). These were also eventually succeeded by the AT\u0026amp;T Unlimited plans in 2017.","All postpaid monthly rate plans (and most prepaid plans) include unlimited minutes for calls to or from any of AT\u0026amp;T's wireless subscribers. Night and weekend minutes were deducted before unlimited M2M minutes until March 2010, in which AT\u0026amp;T stated on wireless bills that M2M minutes would no longer deplete N/W minutes on plans without unlimited N/W minutes. As of November 2009, all postpaid voice plans (except for the \"Nation 450\" ) include unlimited night and weekend usage. If all N\u0026amp;W voice minutes are used, calls placed to non-AT\u0026amp;T wireless customers are deducted from the monthly package of anytime minutes. Any unused \"anytime\" minutes rollover to the next month, and expire after 12 months if not used.","On February 10, 2011, AT\u0026amp;T started offering unlimited mobile calling to any mobile phone on any service provider bundled with unlimited messaging (text, picture, and video).[72]\n\n[73]\n\n","As of September 2011 \"AT\u0026amp;T A-List\" is no longer offered, although it is still supported for existing customers who currently have it.","AT\u0026amp;T Unity is a service offered for users of landline and wireless AT\u0026amp;T service. It provides free unlimited calling to users of AT\u0026amp;T landline and wireless services. AT\u0026amp;T Unity customers also receive \"Rollover\" minutes and night and unlimited weekend minutes. (As of early 2010 \"AT\u0026amp;T Unity\" is no longer offered, although it is still supported for existing customers who have it.)","NumberSync was introduced in 2015. The service allows AT\u0026amp;T postpaid wireless customers to use one telephone number to send and receive calls and text messages across all of their supported devices.[74]\n\n","AT\u0026amp;T Mobility allows its customers to have mobile phone insurance in case of loss or accidental damage. Asurion\nis the administrator of the insurance program from AT\u0026amp;T. All phones are covered under the mobile phone insurance plan except AT\u0026amp;T GoPhones.[75]\n\nCustomers are required to pay a deductible for each time they make an insurance claim, and are only allowed two claims per 12-month period.","As of July 17, 2011 AT\u0026amp;T and Asurion announced that the Apple iPhone will be insurable with their Mobile Protection Pack service.","Cingular Wireless began its sponsorship of the #31 Chevrolet\n, owned by Richard Childress Racing\n, in the NASCAR\nWinston Cup\nSeries in 2002. Two years later\n, when Nextel Communications\n(now Sprint Corporation\n) purchased the naming rights to NASCAR's top division (rebranding the division as the Nextel Cup, and later the Sprint Cup), Cingular and Alltel\n, sponsor of the #12 Dodge\n(owned by Penske Racing\nand driven by Ryan Newman\n), were allowed to stay as sponsors under a grandfather clause\n. In early 2007, following its purchase by AT\u0026amp;T, Cingular began a re-branding effort to the AT\u0026amp;T Mobility brand. NASCAR quickly claimed that a clause in their contract with Sprint Nextel would not allow Cingular to change either the name or brand advertised on the #31 car.","After trying and failing to persuade NASCAR to approve the addition of the AT\u0026amp;T globe logo to the rear of the car, AT\u0026amp;T filed a lawsuit against NASCAR on March 16, 2007. On May 18, AT\u0026amp;T won a preliminary injunction in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia\nin Atlanta\nand, following a failed emergency motion for a stay by NASCAR on May 19, re-branded the #31 car, driven by Jeff Burton\n, in time for the Nextel All-Star Challenge\nthat evening.[76]\n\n[77]\n\nNASCAR was later granted an appeal to be heard on August 2.","On June 17, NASCAR announced it had filed a US$100 million lawsuit against AT\u0026amp;T and would like AT\u0026amp;T and all other telecommunications companies out of the sport in 2008.[78]\n\n","On August 13, a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\ncleared the way for NASCAR to prevent AT\u0026amp;T from featuring its logo on the car. The 11th Circuit dismissed a lower court's ruling that prevented NASCAR from stopping AT\u0026amp;T's plans. The appeals court remanded the case to the district court.[79]\n\n","At first practice for the Sharpie 500\nat Bristol Motor Speedway\non August 24, the #31 car was colored orange and black, but was bare; that is, associate sponsors appeared, but no primary sponsors were on the car, similar to Formula One cars run in races where tobacco advertising is prohibited. The pit crew wore grey Richard Childress Racing shirts and Burton had a plain orange fire suit with associate sponsors. The car, which carried a \"subliminal advertising\" scheme, arrived in a black hauler with only the number 31 on the side. NASCAR officials said the car would not have made it through inspection with the AT\u0026amp;T logos.[80]\n\nDuring that weekend, AT\u0026amp;T claimed that two alternate paint schemes proposed by AT\u0026amp;T\u0026#160;— one advertising its \"go phone\" and another with the old Cingular slogan \"more bars in more places\" that AT\u0026amp;T recently brought back\u0026#160;— were rejected by NASCAR. The Go Phone scheme had been used in the past.[81]\n\nNASCAR later denied these claims.[82]\n\n","The car remained bare on race night on August 25, although ESPN\naired the AT\u0026amp;T logo during shots from its in-car camera. Fox Sports\nhad done so earlier in the dispute, with the words \"Cingular is the new AT\u0026amp;T\" on-screen during these shots.","On September 7, 2007, a settlement was reached where AT\u0026amp;T Mobility could remain on the #31 car until the end of 2008, but the associate sponsorship of the #29 Nationwide Series\nHoliday Inn\nChevrolets not affected, because they are in lower series.[83]\n\n","Richard Childress Racing announced the AT\u0026amp;T Mobility sponsorship will move to Grand American Road Racing Association sportscar racing in 2009 with the sponsorship of the Childress-Howard Motorsports #4 AT\u0026amp;T Pontiac Daytona Prototype sportscar. Childress is a part-owner of this team.","In 2012, AT\u0026amp;T came under scrutiny for throttling the speed of data delivered to consumers with an unlimited data plan. The company has claimed that, despite its claim of network speeds, it is within its legal rights to reduce the speed of data to consumers who reach preset thresholds. In May 2012, Matt Spaccarelli, a truck driver, won a small claims lawsuit against the company for slowing down his service. A Simi Valley, California judge awarded Spaccarelli $850, agreeing that \"unlimited\" service shouldn't be subject to slowdowns.[84]\n\nAdditionally, AT\u0026amp;T's user agreement does not permit class-action suits against the company.[85]\n\n","In May 2013, AT\u0026amp;T added a 61 cent fee per month per line to all of its wireless postpaid lines, including lines still under service contract. The fee appears \"below the line\" making it appear like a tax at the bottom of a customer's phone bill. This fee is thought to bring more than a half-billion dollars in a year for AT\u0026amp;T, which claims the fee is for covering the cost of cell sites and maintenance.[86]\n\n"],"title":"AT\u0026amp;T

By 1995, the owners began franchising\nand expanding across the country.","Atlanta Bread was founded by Robert and Richard Auffenberg[1]\n\nin 1993,[2]\n\nin Sandy Springs, Georgia\n(part of the Atlanta metropolitan area\n), where it started as a single restaurant. In 1994, Jerry Couvaras moved to Atlanta and discovered the restaurant.[1]\n\nThat year, he joined the company as the manager of a restaurant location in Marietta, Georgia\n.[2]\n\nCouvaras was born and raised in South Africa\n, and had previously worked as an investment banker.[3]\n\nCouvaras was appointed as the Atlanta Bread Company's president and chief executive officer\n(CEO) in 1995,[2]\n\nwhile his brother, Basil Couvaras, became the chief operating officer\n(COO) that year.[3]\n\nBy that time, the Couvaras brothers were selling franchises\nunder the Atlanta Bread Company name.[1]\n\n","In 1999, Atlanta Bread Company was among the fastest-growing franchises in the United States, with plans to rapidly double its number of restaurant locations. That year, the Couvaras brothers settled a lawsuit filed by the Auffenbergs the previous year which alleged that they unfairly gained control and ownership of the business. The settlement required that the Couvaras brothers pay the Auffenbergs millions of dollars in royalties\nover the next 15 years.[1]\n\n","In March 2004, Jerry Couvaras was arrested in Johannesburg\n, South Africa and was charged with fraud after approximately 2,000 South Africans lost a total of $5.54 million[4]\n\nas part of an alleged investment scheme that failed in 1993 after the liquidation of two investment companies.[4]\n\nThe charges were unrelated to the Atlanta Bread Company. Basil Couvaras was appointed to run the company while Jerry Couvaras – who remained as president and CEO — stayed in Johannesburg until the charges could be resolved.[2]\n\nBasil Couvaras was later charged in the case as well.[3]\n\n","In November 2004, Jerry and Basil Couvaras pleaded guilty to a banking violation and agreed to pay fines, while remaining fraud charges against them were dismissed. Jerry Couvaras said, \"It was disappointing when it happened because we felt we had not done anything wrong. Unfortunately we had to plead to something. We felt the fine would be the quickest way to get back to doing our business.\" Company officials stated that the charges were related to a decade-old lawsuit that had previously been settled; Jerry Couvaras further stated, \"I think people can really see through what's happened here. People can see what this was really about. I think it was really old animosity.\"[3]\n\n","As of 2004, Atlanta Bread Company had 5,000 employees and was one of the largest cafe and bakery chains in the United States,[2]\n\nwith 170 restaurant locations in 25 states.[3]\n\nSean Lupton-Smith was one of the company's most financially successful franchisees, with five locations that generated profits of nearly $2 million per year. In January 2007, Lupton-Smith sued the company for $12 million, alleging that the company wrongfully terminated his ownership of the restaurants.[5]\n\nRevenue and store locations decreased significantly after 2004, partially because of poor locations and issues with franchisees that included legal problems; the company had sued franchisees or had been sued eight times between 2001 and 2011.[1]\n\n","In 2010, the company had a revenue of $122 million. In 2011, the company had 74 locations in 20 states, including 13 company-owned stores; 44 stores had been closed since 2008, when the Great Recession\nbegan. Jerry Couvaras stated that the store closings were primarily part of a business strategy in order to gain revenue to remodel existing stores that were left open. Between 2001 and 2011, 66 loans from the Small Business Administration\n(SBA) were made to Atlanta Bread Company franchisees. Half of the loans failed, totaling $32.8 million, with a loss of $5 million for the United States federal government.

BellSouth was one of the seven original Regional Bell Operating Companies\nafter the U.S. Department of Justice\nforced the American Telephone \u0026amp; Telegraph Company\nto divest itself of its regional telephone companies on January 1, 1984.","In a merger announced on March 5, 2006, and executed on December 29, 2006, AT\u0026amp;T Inc.\n(originally SBC Communications) acquired BellSouth for approximately $86 billion (1.325 shares of AT\u0026amp;T for each share of BellSouth).[3]\n\nThe merger also consolidated ownership of Cingular Wireless\nand Yellowpages.com\n, both of which were joint ventures between BellSouth and AT\u0026amp;T.[4]\n\nWith the merger completed, wireless services previously offered by Cingular Wireless were then offered under the AT\u0026amp;T name, and BellSouth Telecommunications\n(a subsidiary of Bell Operating Company\n) began doing business as AT\u0026amp;T Southeast\n.[4]\n\n","The company became known as BellSouth, LLC on June 26, 2015.","BellSouth was the last of the Regional Bell Operating Companies to keep its original corporate name after the 1984 AT\u0026amp;T breakup, as well as the last one to retain the Bell logo as part of its main corporate identity.","BellSouth also operated in Argentina, Australia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. BellSouth operated in New Zealand\nunder the name of BellSouth New Zealand Limited\nfrom 1993 until 1998 when it was acquired by Vodafone to become Vodafone New Zealand\n.[5]\n\nIt competed against Telecom New Zealand\n. Its operations in Australia\nwere under the name of BellSouth Australia Pty Limited\n.

The creation of BellSouth, in effect, reunited most telephone service in the Southeastern United States. Southern Bell had been the Bell System operating company for the entire Southeast until 1967, when the western portion of its service territory became South Central Bell.","BellSouth formed a shared services company, BellSouth Services, to provide centralized functions such as engineering\nand information technology\nto Southern Bell and South Central Bell.

Satellite television\nservice was provided as a partnership with DirecTV\n. Cable television\n(often via MMDS\n) was provided in limited markets as BellSouth Entertainment (as part of the Americast\nventure).","The company maintained its largest operation centers in Atlanta and Birmingham. Region-wide headquarters operations were also primarily in Atlanta and Birmingham. Statewide operations centers were located in Birmingham, Miami, Atlanta, Louisville, New Orleans, Jackson, Charlotte, Columbia, and Nashville. BellSouth Mobility was based in Atlanta, Georgia and Birmingham, Alabama.","In August 1998, BellSouth launched FastAccess DSL, their broadband\nservice provided through a DSL\nconnection, initially launched in the Atlanta\n, Birmingham\n, Charlotte\n, Miami\n/Ft. Lauderdale\n, Jacksonville\n, New Orleans\nand Raleigh\n/Durham\nareas. Eventually, it became available in all of BellSouth's service area.","Toward its end, BellSouth realigned itself in two important areas, wireless\nand broadband\n. In 2001, they merged BellSouth Mobility\n, their wireless enterprise, with SBC\n's wireless services, and took 40% stake in the resulting company, Cingular Wireless\n. The new company provided a large percentage of BellSouth's revenue. This joint venture continued after SBC purchased the old AT\u0026amp;T\nand rebranded as AT\u0026amp;T Inc.\nContinued increase of broadband\npenetration and applications in the consumer market was a key strategy to the company. These activities were being funded in part by the sale of Latin America\noperations.","BellSouth became the first \"Baby Bell\" that did not operate pay telephones\n. By 2003, BellSouth's payphone operation was discontinued because it had become too unprofitable, most likely due to the increased availability of cell phones. Cincinnati Bell\nhas taken BellSouth's place for payphones in northern BellSouth territory; independents have set in further south.","BellSouth's main operating units at its end were the Communications Group, Domestic Wireless, and Advertising and Publishing. The communications group operated two wholly owned subsidiaries, BellSouth Telecommunications Inc. (BST)\nand BellSouth Long Distance, Inc. (BSLD)\n. The main marketing groups for the communications group were consumer, small business, large business, and interconnection (wholesale services). The communications group provided wireline communications services, including local exchange, network access, intraLATA long distance services, and Internet services, as well as long distance services.","The advertising and publishing group was responsible for printing and distributing telephone books, selling advertising, and operating online electronic directories.","The BellSouth – SBC/AT\u0026amp;T relationship went further than just Cingular Wireless. BellSouth \u0026amp; SBC/AT\u0026amp;T also co-owned yellowpages.com[7]\n\n(formerly RealPages.com and SmartPages.com).","BellSouth licensed its trademark to US Electronics\n, which produced telephones under the BellSouth brand. It also maintains a history sub-page at bellsouth.com/servicemarks which displays its former and recent BellSouth logo usage.","As of January 1, 2006, BellSouth customers no longer receive caller ID\ninformation from Sprint PCS customers. Any incoming call originating from a Sprint\nPCS cell phone will usually display the City, State format on the caller ID display instead of the name or business name associated with that number. Based on a 1996 agreement between Sprint and BellSouth, it is likely that this is a result of a ten-year contract. In 2003, Sprint sued BellSouth for $20 million as a result of Sprint claiming Bellsouth violated a 1996 contract by not providing Sprint caller-identification information to BellSouth customers.[8]\n\n","Similar caller ID \"deals\" have been left to the consumer to fight either with their own carrier or through government regulatory commissions for what they should have displayed on their caller ID device. In 2002, Sprint and SBC Communications\ncould not come to an agreement on fees charged to carriers to look up the caller name information.[9]\n\n[10]\n\n","In 2006, USA Today\n\npublished an article which claimed that three of the largest United States\ncarriers, including BellSouth, had been supplying calling records to the National Security Agency\nfor all international and domestic calls. This data, the article claimed, is being used to create, \"the largest database ever assembled\n.\"[11]\n\n","On May 16, 2006, BellSouth released a statement claiming that no contract with the NSA existed and that they had never provided information such as calling records to the NSA.[12]\n\n","USA Today\n\nposted an update on June 30, 2006, stating that:","\"On May 15, BellSouth said it could not categorically deny participation in the program until it had conducted a detailed investigation. BellSouth said that internal review concluded that the company did not contract with the NSA or turn over calling records.\"[13]\n\n"],"title":"BellSouth","rels":["/wiki/BellSouth_Telecommunications","/wiki/AT%26T_Mobility#History","/wiki/Graybar_Electric_Company","/wiki/Nortel","/wiki/Bell_Canada","/wiki/Ameritech","/wiki/Verizon_Communications","/wiki/Telcordia_Technologies","Undefined

The restaurant serves breakfast before transitioning to its lunch and dinner menu. Chick-fil-A also offers customers catered selections from its menu for special events.[5]\n\n\nMany of the company's values are influenced by its founder's\nSouthern Baptist beliefs;[6]\n\nmost notably, all Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed for business on Sundays, as well as on Thanksgiving\nand Christmas\n.[6]\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1\nHistory\n\n\n2\nBusiness model\n\n\n3\nAdvertising\n\n\n4\nSponsored events\n\n\n5\nRelated restaurants\n\n5.1\nThe Hapeville Dwarf House\n\n\n5.2\nDwarf House\n\n\n\"\u003e5.3\nTruett's Grill\n\n\n\n\n6\nCorporate culture\n\n6.1\nSame-sex marriage controversy\n\n6.1.1\nResponse\n\n\n6.1.2\nReport of policy change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nRecipe changes\n\n\n8\nPlan to raise its chickens without antibiotics\n\n\n9\nSee also\n\n\n10\nReferences\n\n\n11\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nThe chain's origin can be traced to the Dwarf Grill (now the Dwarf House\n), a restaurant opened by S. Truett Cathy\n, the chain's former chairman and CEO, in 1946. The restaurant is located in Hapeville, Georgia\n, a suburb of Atlanta,[3]\n\nand is near the location of the now-demolished Ford Motor Company Atlanta Assembly\nPlant, for many years a source of many of the restaurant's patrons.\nIn 1961, after 15 years in the fast food business, Cathy found a pressure-fryer that could cook the chicken sandwich in the same amount of time it took to cook a fast-food hamburger.[7]\n\nFollowing this discovery, he registered the name Chick-fil-A, Inc. The company's trademarked slogan, \"We Didn't Invent the Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,\"\n[8]\n\nrefers to their flagship menu item, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich.\nThe first Chick-fil-A opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall\n, in a suburb of Atlanta.[3]\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, the chain expanded by opening new franchises in suburban malls' food courts.[9]\n\nThe first freestanding franchise was opened April 16, 1986, on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, Georgia,[10]\n\nand the company began to focus more on this type of franchise than on the food court type. Although it has expanded outward from its original geographic base, most new restaurants are located in Southern suburban areas.[3]\n\nIn October 2015, the company opened a three-story 5,000-square-foot restaurant in Manhattan\nthat became the largest free-standing Chick-fil-A in the country at that time.[11]\n\n[12]\n\nAs of 2016, the chain has approximately 1,950 locations.[3]\n\nIt also has 31 drive-through\n-only locations.[3]\n\nChick-fil-A also can be found at universities, hospitals, and airports through licensing agreements.[3]\n\n\nSince 1997, the Atlanta-based company has been the title sponsor of the Peach Bowl\n, an annual college football\nbowl game played in Atlanta on a\u003e. Chick-fil-A also is a key sponsor of the SEC\nand the ACC\nof college athletics.[13]\n\n[14]\n\n\nThe company expanded for the first time outside of the United States by opening an outlet at the Calgary International Airport\nin Calgary\n, Alberta, Canada in May 2014.[15]\n\n[16]\n\nThis restaurant is located near the departure area for flights bound for the United States.[15]\n\nHowever, as with its American locations, it is closed Sundays and Christmas Day (it is, however, open on what would be Thanksgiving Day in America; as Thanksgiving Day is an American holiday).\nBusiness model\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nChick-fil-A retains ownership of each restaurant. Chick-fil-A selects the restaurant location and builds it.[17]\n\nChick-fil-A franchisees need only a $10,000 initial investment to become an operator.[18]\n\nEach operator is handpicked and goes through a rigorous training program; the interviews plus training can take months and is not an easy process. Chick-fil-A states on their site:\n\n\"This is not the right opportunity for you if you:\n- Are seeking a passive investment in a business.\n- Want to sell property to Chick-fil-A, Inc.\n- Are requesting that Chick-fil-A, Inc. build at a specified location.\n- Are seeking multi-unit franchise opportunities.\"\n\nThis goes to show how vastly different it is to be a Chick-fil-A store operator rather than being part of a regular franchise opportunity.[19]\n\nSince 2010, Chick-fil-A has led the fast food industry in average sales per restaurant, despite being open only six days a week,[20]\n\nearning an average $4.8 million per restaurant in 2016 (Whataburger\nwas second with $2.7 million per restaurant).[21]\n\n\nAdvertising\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n\"Eat Mor Chikin\" is the chain's most prominent advertising slogan, created by The Richards Group\nin 1995. The slogan is often seen in advertisements, featuring Holstein\ndairy cows[22]\n\nthat are often seen wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read: \"Eat Mor Chikin\" in all capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily halted during a mad cow disease\nscare on January 1, 2004, so as not to make the chain seem insensitive or appear to be taking advantage of the scare to increase its sales. Two months later, the cows were put up again. The cows replaced the chain's old mascot, Doodles, an anthropomorphized\nchicken who still appears as the C on the logo.[23]\n\n\nChick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property, sending cease and desist\nletters to those they think have infringed on their trademarks.[24]\n\nThe corporation has successfully protested at least 30 instances of the use of an \"eat more\" phrase, saying that the use would cause confusion of the public, dilute the distinctiveness of their intellectual property, and diminish its value.[25]\n\n\nA 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who screen prints\nT-shirts reading: \"Eat More Kale\" demanded that he cease printing the shirts and turn over his website.[26]\n\nThe incident drew criticism from Vermont governor Peter Shumlin\n, and created backlash against what he termed Chick-fil-A's \"corporate bullying.\"[27]\n\nOn December 11, 2014, Bo Muller-Moore announced that the U.S. Patent Office granted his application to trademark his \"Eat More Kale\" phrase. A formal announcement of his victory took place on December 12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the Statehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and national attention, the support of Shumlin, and a team of pro-bono law students from the University of New Hampshire legal clinic.[28]\n\n\nAfter 22 years with The Richards Group, Chick-fil-A switched to McCann New York\nin 2016. Along with the cows, ads included famous people in history in a campaign called \"Chicken for Breakfast. It's not as crazy as you think.\"[29]\n\n\nSponsored events\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nChick-fil-A Classic\nThe Chick-fil-A Classic is a high school basketball tournament held in Columbia, South Carolina\n.[30]\n\nThe tournament is in its eighth year of operation and features nationally ranked players, and teams.[31]\n\nThe tournament is co-sponsored by the Greater Columbia Educational Advancement Foundation (GCEAF), which provides scholarships to high school seniors in the greater Columbia area.\n\nChick-fil-A Peach Bowl\n\nThe Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl is a college football bowl game\nplayed each year in Atlanta, Georgia\n.\n\nChick-fil-A Kickoff Game\n\nThe Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game is an annual early-season college football game played at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium\nin Atlanta, Georgia; before 2017, it was played at the Georgia Dome\n. It features two highly ranked teams, one of which has always been from the Southeastern Conference. In the 2012 season and again in the 2014 season, the event was expanded to two games. It will also be two games in 2017.\n\nChick-fil-A Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America\n\nThe Chick-fil-A Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America is an annual charity motorcycle tour to raise money for, among other charities, Victory Junction, a camp for terminally ill children.\n\nRelated restaurants\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nThe Hapeville Dwarf House\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nTruett Cathy opened his first restaurant, The Dwarf Grill\u0026#160;– later renamed the Dwarf House\u0026#160;– in Hapeville, Georgia\n, in 1946, and developed the pressure-cooked chicken breast sandwich there.[3]\n\nAt the original Chick-fil-A Dwarf Grill, in addition to the full-size entrances, there is also an extra small-sized front door.[32]\n\nThe original Dwarf House in Hapeville, Georgia is open 24 hours a day, six days a week, except on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The store closes at 10:00\u0026#160;p.m. on Saturday nights, and the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas and reopens at 6\u0026#160;a.m. on Monday mornings and day after Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has a larger dine-in menu than the other Dwarf House locations as well as an animated seven dwarfs display in the back of the restaurant.[32]\n\nIt was across the street from the former Ford Motor Company\nfactory called Atlanta Assembly\n.\n\n\n\n\nDwarf House in Griffin, Georgia\n\n\n\nDwarf House\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nTruett's original, full-service restaurants offer a substantial menu and provide customers a choice of table service, walk-up counter service or a drive-thru window. As of 2012[update]\n\n, 13 Chick-fil-A Dwarf House restaurants were operating in the metro Atlanta area.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruett's Grill in Griffin, Georgia\n\n\n\n\n\"Truett's_Grill\"\u003eTruett's Grill\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn 1996, the first Truett's Grill was opened in Morrow, Georgia\n. The second location opened in 2003 in McDonough, Georgia\n, and a third location opened in 2006 in Griffin, Georgia\n.[33]\n\nSimilar to the Chick-fil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional, sit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed dinner.[34]\n\n[35]\n\n[36]\n\nIn 2017, Chick-fil-A demolished several Dwarf House locations to replace them with Truett's Grill locations.[37]\n\n[38]\n\n\nCorporate culture\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nS. Truett Cathy was a devout Southern Baptist\n; his religious beliefs had a major impact on the company.[39]\n\nThe company's official statement of corporate purpose says that the business exists \"To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\"[40]\n\n\nCathy's beliefs are also responsible for the chain's most well-known and distinctive feature: all Chick-fil-A locations (both corporate owned and franchised) are closed on Sundays\n,[41]\n\nas well as on Thanksgiving\nand Christmas\n.[42]\n\nCathy states as the final step in his Five-Step recipe for Business Success \"I was not so committed to financial success that I was willing to abandon my principles and priorities. One of the most visible examples of this is our decision to close on Sunday. Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business.\"[43]\n\n\nIn an interview with ABC News's Nightline\n\n, Truett's son Dan T. Cathy\ntold reporter Vicki Mabrey\nthat the company is also closed on Sundays because \"by the time Sunday came, he was just worn out. And Sunday was not a big trading day, anyway, at the time. So he was closed that first Sunday and we've been closed ever since. He figured if he didn't like working on Sundays, that other people didn't either.\" The younger Cathy also quoted his father as saying, \"I don't want to ask people to do that what I am not willing to do myself.\"[44]\n\n\nTheir website states, \"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our Restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect –regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\"[45]\n\n\nChick-fil-A's reputation on being closed on Sundays extends to non-traditional locations. In addition to countless shopping malls and airports, a Chick-fil-A location at Mercedes-Benz Stadium\nin Atlanta will be closed on Sundays despite its main tenant, the Atlanta Falcons\n, playing most of their home games on Sundays. The location will be open when the Falcons have a Monday night\n, Thursday night\nor Saturday home game, as well as non-Sunday home games of Atlanta United FC\nand other events at the stadium. On Sundays, the digital signs will be flipped and concessionaire Levy Restaurants\nwill sell nonbranded food and drinks at the location.[46]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage controversy\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nMain article: Chick-fil-A same-sex marriage controversy\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chick-fil-A in Port Charlotte, Florida\n, on August 1, 2012 \"Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtestors at Memphis, Tennessee\n, Chick-fil-A store on Same Sex Kiss Day\n\n\nIn January 2011, the media reported that Chick-fil-A was co-sponsoring a marriage conference with the Pennsylvania Family Institute (PFI), an organization that has opposed same-sex marriage\nlegislation.[47]\n\n[48]\n\n[49]\n\n[50]\n\n[51]\n\nChick-fil-A clarified that \"one of our independent Restaurant Operators in Pennsylvania was asked to provide sandwiches to two Art of Marriage video seminars\".[52]\n\nThe WinShape Foundation\n, a charitable organization founded by Truett and his wife, also stated that it would not allow same-sex couples to participate in its marriage retreats.[53]\n\n\nChick-fil-A has donated over $5\u0026#160;million, via WinShape, to groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Of this, more than $3\u0026#160;million was donated primarily to Christian organizations whose agendas included positions that oppose same-sex marriage,[54]\n\nwith the money donated between 2003 and 2009.[55]\n\n[56]\n\n[57]\n\n[58]\n\n[59]\n\n[60]\n\n[61]\n\n[62]\n\nA total of $1.9\u0026#160;million was donated in 2010 to groups such as the Marriage \u0026amp; Family Foundation, Exodus International\n, and the Family Research Council\n(FRC).\"#cite_note-O'Connor-63\"\u003e[63]\n\nThat year, the FRC, which received $1,000[55]\n\n[56]\n\n[57]\n\n[58]\n\n[59]\n\n[60]\n\n[61]\n\n[62]\n\nwas listed as an anti-gay[64]\n\nhate group\nby the Southern Poverty Law Center\n.[65]\n\n[66]\n\n[67]\n\nWinShape has also contributed to Christian groups including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes\nand Exodus International\n, the latter is noted for supporting ex-gay conversion therapy\n.\u003eresponse, students at several colleges and universities worked to ban or remove the company's restaurants from their campuses. On January 28, 2013, Shane L. Windmeyer, the leader of Campus Pride\n, suspended their campaign.[68]\n\n[69]\n\n[70]\n\n\nIn June and July 2012, Chick-fil-A's chief operating officer\nDan T. Cathy made several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who \"have the audacity to define what marriage is about\" were \"inviting God's judgment on our nation\".[71]\n\n[72]\n\n[73]\n\n[74]\n\n[75]\n\nSeveral prominent politicians expressed disapproval.[76]\n\nBoston Mayor\nThomas Menino\nand Chicago Alderman\nProco \"Joe\" Moreno\nsaid they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas.[77]\n\n[78]\n\n[79]\n\nThe proposed bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union\n.[80]\n\n[81]\n\n[82]\n\nThe Jim Henson Company\n, which had a Pajanimals\n\nkids' meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay \u0026amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation\n.[83]\n\n[84]\n\n[85]\n\nChick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, claiming that unrelated safety concerns that had arisen prior to the controversy.[86]\n\nChick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying, \"We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\"[87]\n\n\nResponse\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn response to the controversy, former Arkansas\nGovernor Mike Huckabee\ninitiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott\nof Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists.[88]\n\n[89]\n\n[90]\n\nMore than 600,000 people RSVPed on Facebook\nfor Huckabee's appreciation event.[89]\n\nOn August 1, Chick-fil-A restaurants experienced a large show of public support across the nation with the company reporting record-breaking sales.[88]\n\n[89]\n\n[90]\n\nA consulting firm estimated that the average Chick-fil-A restaurant had 29.9 percent more sales and 367 more customers than it did on a typical Wednesday.[18]\n\n\nReport of policy change\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn September 2012, The Civil Rights Agenda\n(TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A had \"ceased donating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against LGBT civil rights.\" Chick-fil-A officials did state in an internal document that they \"will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation.\"[91]\n\nIn a letter from Chick-fil-A's Senior Director of Real Estate, the company states, \"The WinShape Foundation is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas.\"[92]\n\n[93]\n\n\nAccording to Chicago Alderman\nProco \"Joe\" Moreno\n, Chick-fil-A has a statement of respect for all people regardless of sexual orientation\nin an internal document called Chick-fil-A: Who We Are\n. A document released by Chick-fil-A on September 20, 2012, does not mention any organizations opposed to same-sex marriage as being part of Chick-fil-A's donation base. WinShape Marriage will continue to be supported financially, with a stated focus on couple retreats to strengthen marriages.[94]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChick-fil-A in Hillsboro, Oregon\n\n\n\nAccording to Focus on the Family\n's website, CitizenLink.com\n, \"Chick-fil-A and its charitable-giving arm, the WinShape Foundation, did not agree to stop making donations to groups that support the Biblical definition of marriage in exchange for being allowed to open a franchise in Chicago.\"[95]\n\nMike Huckabee stated that he \"talked earlier today personally with Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick Fil-A about the new reports that Chick Fil-A had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same sex marriage. This is not true. The company continues to focus on the fair treatment of all of its customers and employees, but to end confusion gave me this statement.\" The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on Huckabee's website.[96]\n\n[97]\n\n\nRecipe changes\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nThough Chick-fil-A has always used trans-fat\nfree processes in its chicken sandwiches, anticipating the dietary concerns of consumers, in 2008, it became the first fast-food restaurant to become completely trans-fat free.[98]\n\n\nIn 2011, food blogger and activist Vani Hari\nwrote a post titled \"Chick-fil-A or Chemical Fil-A?\" on her website, FoodBabe.com. She noted that Chick-fil-A sandwiches contained nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil\nwith TBHQ\n.[99]\n\nIn October 2012, Chick-fil-A invited Hari to meet with company executives at its Atlanta, GA\nheadquarters.[100]\n\nIn December 2013, Chick-fil-A notified Hari that it had eliminated the dye Yellow No. 5\nand had reduced the sodium\ncontent in its chicken soup. The company also said that it is testing a peanut oil that does not contain TBHQ and that it would start testing sauces and dressings made without high-fructose corn syrup\nin 2014.[100]\n\n\nPlan to raise its chickens without antibiotics\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration\n, antibiotics used in livestock, many of which are also used to treat humans, have contributed to the rise of dangerous bacteria. In December 2012, the FDA announced plans to phase out certain antibiotics in the food production industry.[101]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Chick-fil-A announced plans to serve chicken raised without antibiotics in its restaurants nationwide within five years. Chick-fil-A is the first quick service restaurant to set forth a plan and commit to serving only poultry raised without antibiotics.[102]\n\n\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nList of fast-food chicken restaurants\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlanta portal\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness and economics portal\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies portal\n\n\n\n\n\nFood portal\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n^\n\n\n\"Company Fact Sheet\"\n.

Truett Cathy\n, the chain's former chairman and CEO, in 1946. The restaurant is located in Hapeville, Georgia\n, a suburb of Atlanta,[3]\n\nand is near the location of the now-demolished Ford Motor Company Atlanta Assembly\nPlant, for many years a source of many of the restaurant's patrons.","In 1961, after 15 years in the fast food business, Cathy found a pressure-fryer that could cook the chicken sandwich in the same amount of time it took to cook a fast-food hamburger.[7]\n\nFollowing this discovery, he registered the name Chick-fil-A, Inc. The company's trademarked slogan, \"We Didn't Invent the Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,\"\n[8]\n\nrefers to their flagship menu item, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich.","The first Chick-fil-A opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall\n, in a suburb of Atlanta.[3]\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, the chain expanded by opening new franchises in suburban malls' food courts.[9]\n\nThe first freestanding franchise was opened April 16, 1986, on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, Georgia,[10]\n\nand the company began to focus more on this type of franchise than on the food court type. Although it has expanded outward from its original geographic base, most new restaurants are located in Southern suburban areas.[3]\n\nIn October 2015, the company opened a three-story 5,000-square-foot restaurant in Manhattan\nthat became the largest free-standing Chick-fil-A in the country at that time.[11]\n\n[12]\n\nAs of 2016, the chain has approximately 1,950 locations.[3]\n\nIt also has 31 drive-through\n-only locations.[3]\n\nChick-fil-A also can be found at universities, hospitals, and airports through licensing agreements.[3]\n\n","Since 1997, the Atlanta-based company has been the title sponsor of the Peach Bowl\n, an annual college football\nbowl game played in Atlanta on a\u003e. Chick-fil-A also is a key sponsor of the SEC\nand the ACC\nof college athletics.[13]\n\n[14]\n\n\nThe company expanded for the first time outside of the United States by opening an outlet at the Calgary International Airport\nin Calgary\n, Alberta, Canada in May 2014.[15]\n\n[16]\n\nThis restaurant is located near the departure area for flights bound for the United States.[15]\n\nHowever, as with its American locations, it is closed Sundays and Christmas Day (it is, however, open on what would be Thanksgiving Day in America; as Thanksgiving Day is an American holiday).\nBusiness model\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nChick-fil-A retains ownership of each restaurant. Chick-fil-A selects the restaurant location and builds it.[17]\n\nChick-fil-A franchisees need only a $10,000 initial investment to become an operator.[18]\n\nEach operator is handpicked and goes through a rigorous training program; the interviews plus training can take months and is not an easy process. Chick-fil-A states on their site:\n\n\"This is not the right opportunity for you if you:\n- Are seeking a passive investment in a business.\n- Want to sell property to Chick-fil-A, Inc.\n- Are requesting that Chick-fil-A, Inc. build at a specified location.\n- Are seeking multi-unit franchise opportunities.\"\n\nThis goes to show how vastly different it is to be a Chick-fil-A store operator rather than being part of a regular franchise opportunity.[19]\n\nSince 2010, Chick-fil-A has led the fast food industry in average sales per restaurant, despite being open only six days a week,[20]\n\nearning an average $4.8 million per restaurant in 2016 (Whataburger\nwas second with $2.7 million per restaurant).[21]\n\n\nAdvertising\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n\"Eat Mor Chikin\" is the chain's most prominent advertising slogan, created by The Richards Group\nin 1995. The slogan is often seen in advertisements, featuring Holstein\ndairy cows[22]\n\nthat are often seen wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read: \"Eat Mor Chikin\" in all capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily halted during a mad cow disease\nscare on January 1, 2004, so as not to make the chain seem insensitive or appear to be taking advantage of the scare to increase its sales. Two months later, the cows were put up again. The cows replaced the chain's old mascot, Doodles, an anthropomorphized\nchicken who still appears as the C on the logo.[23]\n\n\nChick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property, sending cease and desist\nletters to those they think have infringed on their trademarks.[24]\n\nThe corporation has successfully protested at least 30 instances of the use of an \"eat more\" phrase, saying that the use would cause confusion of the public, dilute the distinctiveness of their intellectual property, and diminish its value.[25]\n\n\nA 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who screen prints\nT-shirts reading: \"Eat More Kale\" demanded that he cease printing the shirts and turn over his website.[26]\n\nThe incident drew criticism from Vermont governor Peter Shumlin\n, and created backlash against what he termed Chick-fil-A's \"corporate bullying.\"[27]\n\nOn December 11, 2014, Bo Muller-Moore announced that the U.S. Patent Office granted his application to trademark his \"Eat More Kale\" phrase. A formal announcement of his victory took place on December 12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the Statehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and national attention, the support of Shumlin, and a team of pro-bono law students from the University of New Hampshire legal clinic.[28]\n\n\nAfter 22 years with The Richards Group, Chick-fil-A switched to McCann New York\nin 2016. Along with the cows, ads included famous people in history in a campaign called \"Chicken for Breakfast. It's not as crazy as you think.\"[29]\n\n\nSponsored events\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nChick-fil-A Classic\nThe Chick-fil-A Classic is a high school basketball tournament held in Columbia, South Carolina\n.[30]\n\nThe tournament is in its eighth year of operation and features nationally ranked players, and teams.[31]\n\nThe tournament is co-sponsored by the Greater Columbia Educational Advancement Foundation (GCEAF), which provides scholarships to high school seniors in the greater Columbia area.\n\nChick-fil-A Peach Bowl\n\nThe Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl is a college football bowl game\nplayed each year in Atlanta, Georgia\n.\n\nChick-fil-A Kickoff Game\n\nThe Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game is an annual early-season college football game played at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium\nin Atlanta, Georgia; before 2017, it was played at the Georgia Dome\n. It features two highly ranked teams, one of which has always been from the Southeastern Conference. In the 2012 season and again in the 2014 season, the event was expanded to two games. It will also be two games in 2017.\n\nChick-fil-A Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America\n\nThe Chick-fil-A Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America is an annual charity motorcycle tour to raise money for, among other charities, Victory Junction, a camp for terminally ill children.\n\nRelated restaurants\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nThe Hapeville Dwarf House\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nTruett Cathy opened his first restaurant, The Dwarf Grill\u0026#160;– later renamed the Dwarf House\u0026#160;– in Hapeville, Georgia\n, in 1946, and developed the pressure-cooked chicken breast sandwich there.[3]\n\nAt the original Chick-fil-A Dwarf Grill, in addition to the full-size entrances, there is also an extra small-sized front door.[32]\n\nThe original Dwarf House in Hapeville, Georgia is open 24 hours a day, six days a week, except on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The store closes at 10:00\u0026#160;p.m. on Saturday nights, and the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas and reopens at 6\u0026#160;a.m. on Monday mornings and day after Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has a larger dine-in menu than the other Dwarf House locations as well as an animated seven dwarfs display in the back of the restaurant.[32]\n\nIt was across the street from the former Ford Motor Company\nfactory called Atlanta Assembly\n.\n\n\n\n\nDwarf House in Griffin, Georgia\n\n\n\nDwarf House\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nTruett's original, full-service restaurants offer a substantial menu and provide customers a choice of table service, walk-up counter service or a drive-thru window. As of 2012[update]\n\n, 13 Chick-fil-A Dwarf House restaurants were operating in the metro Atlanta area.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruett's Grill in Griffin, Georgia\n\n\n\n\n\"Truett's_Grill\"\u003eTruett's Grill\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn 1996, the first Truett's Grill was opened in Morrow, Georgia\n. The second location opened in 2003 in McDonough, Georgia\n, and a third location opened in 2006 in Griffin, Georgia\n.[33]\n\nSimilar to the Chick-fil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional, sit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed dinner.[34]\n\n[35]\n\n[36]\n\nIn 2017, Chick-fil-A demolished several Dwarf House locations to replace them with Truett's Grill locations.[37]\n\n[38]\n\n\nCorporate culture\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nS. Truett Cathy was a devout Southern Baptist\n; his religious beliefs had a major impact on the company.[39]\n\nThe company's official statement of corporate purpose says that the business exists \"To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\"[40]\n\n\nCathy's beliefs are also responsible for the chain's most well-known and distinctive feature: all Chick-fil-A locations (both corporate owned and franchised) are closed on Sundays\n,[41]\n\nas well as on Thanksgiving\nand Christmas\n.[42]\n\nCathy states as the final step in his Five-Step recipe for Business Success \"I was not so committed to financial success that I was willing to abandon my principles and priorities. One of the most visible examples of this is our decision to close on Sunday. Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business.\"[43]\n\n\nIn an interview with ABC News's Nightline\n\n, Truett's son Dan T. Cathy\ntold reporter Vicki Mabrey\nthat the company is also closed on Sundays because \"by the time Sunday came, he was just worn out. And Sunday was not a big trading day, anyway, at the time. So he was closed that first Sunday and we've been closed ever since. He figured if he didn't like working on Sundays, that other people didn't either.\" The younger Cathy also quoted his father as saying, \"I don't want to ask people to do that what I am not willing to do myself.\"[44]\n\n\nTheir website states, \"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our Restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect –regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\"[45]\n\n\nChick-fil-A's reputation on being closed on Sundays extends to non-traditional locations. In addition to countless shopping malls and airports, a Chick-fil-A location at Mercedes-Benz Stadium\nin Atlanta will be closed on Sundays despite its main tenant, the Atlanta Falcons\n, playing most of their home games on Sundays. The location will be open when the Falcons have a Monday night\n, Thursday night\nor Saturday home game, as well as non-Sunday home games of Atlanta United FC\nand other events at the stadium. On Sundays, the digital signs will be flipped and concessionaire Levy Restaurants\nwill sell nonbranded food and drinks at the location.[46]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage controversy\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nMain article: Chick-fil-A same-sex marriage controversy\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chick-fil-A in Port Charlotte, Florida\n, on August 1, 2012 \"Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtestors at Memphis, Tennessee\n, Chick-fil-A store on Same Sex Kiss Day\n\n\nIn January 2011, the media reported that Chick-fil-A was co-sponsoring a marriage conference with the Pennsylvania Family Institute (PFI), an organization that has opposed same-sex marriage\nlegislation.[47]\n\n[48]\n\n[49]\n\n[50]\n\n[51]\n\nChick-fil-A clarified that \"one of our independent Restaurant Operators in Pennsylvania was asked to provide sandwiches to two Art of Marriage video seminars\".[52]\n\nThe WinShape Foundation\n, a charitable organization founded by Truett and his wife, also stated that it would not allow same-sex couples to participate in its marriage retreats.[53]\n\n\nChick-fil-A has donated over $5\u0026#160;million, via WinShape, to groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Of this, more than $3\u0026#160;million was donated primarily to Christian organizations whose agendas included positions that oppose same-sex marriage,[54]\n\nwith the money donated between 2003 and 2009.[55]\n\n[56]\n\n[57]\n\n[58]\n\n[59]\n\n[60]\n\n[61]\n\n[62]\n\nA total of $1.9\u0026#160;million was donated in 2010 to groups such as the Marriage \u0026amp; Family Foundation, Exodus International\n, and the Family Research Council\n(FRC).\"#cite_note-O'Connor-63\"\u003e[63]\n\nThat year, the FRC, which received $1,000[55]\n\n[56]\n\n[57]\n\n[58]\n\n[59]\n\n[60]\n\n[61]\n\n[62]\n\nwas listed as an anti-gay[64]\n\nhate group\nby the Southern Poverty Law Center\n.[65]\n\n[66]\n\n[67]\n\nWinShape has also contributed to Christian groups including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes\nand Exodus International\n, the latter is noted for supporting ex-gay conversion therapy\n.\u003eresponse, students at several colleges and universities worked to ban or remove the company's restaurants from their campuses. On January 28, 2013, Shane L. Windmeyer, the leader of Campus Pride\n, suspended their campaign.[68]\n\n[69]\n\n[70]\n\n\nIn June and July 2012, Chick-fil-A's chief operating officer\nDan T. Cathy made several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who \"have the audacity to define what marriage is about\" were \"inviting God's judgment on our nation\".[71]\n\n[72]\n\n[73]\n\n[74]\n\n[75]\n\nSeveral prominent politicians expressed disapproval.[76]\n\nBoston Mayor\nThomas Menino\nand Chicago Alderman\nProco \"Joe\" Moreno\nsaid they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas.[77]\n\n[78]\n\n[79]\n\nThe proposed bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union\n.[80]\n\n[81]\n\n[82]\n\nThe Jim Henson Company\n, which had a Pajanimals\n\nkids' meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay \u0026amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation\n.[83]\n\n[84]\n\n[85]\n\nChick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, claiming that unrelated safety concerns that had arisen prior to the controversy.[86]\n\nChick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying, \"We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\"[87]\n\n\nResponse\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn response to the controversy, former Arkansas\nGovernor Mike Huckabee\ninitiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott\nof Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists.[88]\n\n[89]\n\n[90]\n\nMore than 600,000 people RSVPed on Facebook\nfor Huckabee's appreciation event.[89]\n\nOn August 1, Chick-fil-A restaurants experienced a large show of public support across the nation with the company reporting record-breaking sales.[88]\n\n[89]\n\n[90]\n\nA consulting firm estimated that the average Chick-fil-A restaurant had 29.9 percent more sales and 367 more customers than it did on a typical Wednesday.[18]\n\n\nReport of policy change\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn September 2012, The Civil Rights Agenda\n(TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A had \"ceased donating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against LGBT civil rights.\" Chick-fil-A officials did state in an internal document that they \"will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation.\"[91]\n\nIn a letter from Chick-fil-A's Senior Director of Real Estate, the company states, \"The WinShape Foundation is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas.\"[92]\n\n[93]\n\n\nAccording to Chicago Alderman\nProco \"Joe\" Moreno\n, Chick-fil-A has a statement of respect for all people regardless of sexual orientation\nin an internal document called Chick-fil-A: Who We Are\n. A document released by Chick-fil-A on September 20, 2012, does not mention any organizations opposed to same-sex marriage as being part of Chick-fil-A's donation base. WinShape Marriage will continue to be supported financially, with a stated focus on couple retreats to strengthen marriages.[94]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChick-fil-A in Hillsboro, Oregon\n\n\n\nAccording to Focus on the Family\n's website, CitizenLink.com\n, \"Chick-fil-A and its charitable-giving arm, the WinShape Foundation, did not agree to stop making donations to groups that support the Biblical definition of marriage in exchange for being allowed to open a franchise in Chicago.\"[95]\n\nMike Huckabee stated that he \"talked earlier today personally with Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick Fil-A about the new reports that Chick Fil-A had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same sex marriage. This is not true. The company continues to focus on the fair treatment of all of its customers and employees, but to end confusion gave me this statement.\" The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on Huckabee's website.[96]\n\n[97]\n\n\nRecipe changes\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nThough Chick-fil-A has always used trans-fat\nfree processes in its chicken sandwiches, anticipating the dietary concerns of consumers, in 2008, it became the first fast-food restaurant to become completely trans-fat free.[98]\n\n\nIn 2011, food blogger and activist Vani Hari\nwrote a post titled \"Chick-fil-A or Chemical Fil-A?\" on her website, FoodBabe.com. She noted that Chick-fil-A sandwiches contained nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil\nwith TBHQ\n.[99]\n\nIn October 2012, Chick-fil-A invited Hari to meet with company executives at its Atlanta, GA\nheadquarters.[100]\n\nIn December 2013, Chick-fil-A notified Hari that it had eliminated the dye Yellow No. 5\nand had reduced the sodium\ncontent in its chicken soup. The company also said that it is testing a peanut oil that does not contain TBHQ and that it would start testing sauces and dressings made without high-fructose corn syrup\nin 2014.[100]\n\n\nPlan to raise its chickens without antibiotics\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration\n, antibiotics used in livestock, many of which are also used to treat humans, have contributed to the rise of dangerous bacteria. In December 2012, the FDA announced plans to phase out certain antibiotics in the food production industry.[101]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Chick-fil-A announced plans to serve chicken raised without antibiotics in its restaurants nationwide within five years. Chick-fil-A is the first quick service restaurant to set forth a plan and commit to serving only poultry raised without antibiotics.[102]\n\n\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nList of fast-food chicken restaurants\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlanta portal\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness and economics portal\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies portal\n\n\n\n\n\nFood portal\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n^\n\n\n\"Company Fact Sheet\"\n.

Chick-fil-A selects the restaurant location and builds it.[17]\n\nChick-fil-A franchisees need only a $10,000 initial investment to become an operator.[18]\n\nEach operator is handpicked and goes through a rigorous training program; the interviews plus training can take months and is not an easy process. Chick-fil-A states on their site:\n\n\"This is not the right opportunity for you if you:\n- Are seeking a passive investment in a business.\n- Want to sell property to Chick-fil-A, Inc.\n- Are requesting that Chick-fil-A, Inc. build at a specified location.\n- Are seeking multi-unit franchise opportunities.\"\n\nThis goes to show how vastly different it is to be a Chick-fil-A store operator rather than being part of a regular franchise opportunity.[19]\n\nSince 2010, Chick-fil-A has led the fast food industry in average sales per restaurant, despite being open only six days a week,[20]\n\nearning an average $4.8 million per restaurant in 2016 (Whataburger\nwas second with $2.7 million per restaurant).[21]\n\n","\"Eat Mor Chikin\" is the chain's most prominent advertising slogan, created by The Richards Group\nin 1995. The slogan is often seen in advertisements, featuring Holstein\ndairy cows[22]\n\nthat are often seen wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read: \"Eat Mor Chikin\" in all capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily halted during a mad cow disease\nscare on January 1, 2004, so as not to make the chain seem insensitive or appear to be taking advantage of the scare to increase its sales. Two months later, the cows were put up again. The cows replaced the chain's old mascot, Doodles, an anthropomorphized\nchicken who still appears as the C on the logo.[23]\n\n","Chick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property, sending cease and desist\nletters to those they think have infringed on their trademarks.[24]\n\nThe corporation has successfully protested at least 30 instances of the use of an \"eat more\" phrase, saying that the use would cause confusion of the public, dilute the distinctiveness of their intellectual property, and diminish its value.[25]\n\n","A 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who screen prints\nT-shirts reading: \"Eat More Kale\" demanded that he cease printing the shirts and turn over his website.[26]\n\nThe incident drew criticism from Vermont governor Peter Shumlin\n, and created backlash against what he termed Chick-fil-A's \"corporate bullying.\"[27]\n\nOn December 11, 2014, Bo Muller-Moore announced that the U.S. Patent Office granted his application to trademark his \"Eat More Kale\" phrase. A formal announcement of his victory took place on December 12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the Statehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and national attention, the support of Shumlin, and a team of pro-bono law students from the University of New Hampshire legal clinic.[28]\n\n","After 22 years with The Richards Group, Chick-fil-A switched to McCann New York\nin 2016. Along with the cows, ads included famous people in history in a campaign called \"Chicken for Breakfast. It's not as crazy as you think.\"[29]\n\n","Truett Cathy opened his first restaurant, The Dwarf Grill\u0026#160;– later renamed the Dwarf House\u0026#160;– in Hapeville, Georgia\n, in 1946, and developed the pressure-cooked chicken breast sandwich there.[3]\n\nAt the original Chick-fil-A Dwarf Grill, in addition to the full-size entrances, there is also an extra small-sized front door.[32]\n\nThe original Dwarf House in Hapeville, Georgia is open 24 hours a day, six days a week, except on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The store closes at 10:00\u0026#160;p.m. on Saturday nights, and the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas and reopens at 6\u0026#160;a.m. on Monday mornings and day after Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has a larger dine-in menu than the other Dwarf House locations as well as an animated seven dwarfs display in the back of the restaurant.[32]\n\nIt was across the street from the former Ford Motor Company\nfactory called Atlanta Assembly\n.","Truett's original, full-service restaurants offer a substantial menu and provide customers a choice of table service, walk-up counter service or a drive-thru window. As of 2012[update]\n\n, 13 Chick-fil-A Dwarf House restaurants were operating in the metro Atlanta area.[3]\n\n","In 1996, the first Truett's Grill was opened in Morrow, Georgia\n. The second location opened in 2003 in McDonough, Georgia\n, and a third location opened in 2006 in Griffin, Georgia\n.[33]\n\nSimilar to the Chick-fil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional, sit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed dinner.[34]\n\n[35]\n\n[36]\n\nIn 2017, Chick-fil-A demolished several Dwarf House locations to replace them with Truett's Grill locations.[37]\n\n[38]\n\n","S. Truett Cathy was a devout Southern Baptist\n; his religious beliefs had a major impact on the company.[39]\n\nThe company's official statement of corporate purpose says that the business exists \"To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\"[40]\n\n","Cathy's beliefs are also responsible for the chain's most well-known and distinctive feature: all Chick-fil-A locations (both corporate owned and franchised) are closed on Sundays\n,[41]\n\nas well as on Thanksgiving\nand Christmas\n.[42]\n\nCathy states as the final step in his Five-Step recipe for Business Success \"I was not so committed to financial success that I was willing to abandon my principles and priorities. One of the most visible examples of this is our decision to close on Sunday. Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business.\"[43]\n\n","In an interview with ABC News's Nightline\n\n, Truett's son Dan T. Cathy\ntold reporter Vicki Mabrey\nthat the company is also closed on Sundays because \"by the time Sunday came, he was just worn out. And Sunday was not a big trading day, anyway, at the time. So he was closed that first Sunday and we've been closed ever since. He figured if he didn't like working on Sundays, that other people didn't either.\" The younger Cathy also quoted his father as saying, \"I don't want to ask people to do that what I am not willing to do myself.\"[44]\n\n","Their website states, \"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our Restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect –regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\"[45]\n\n","Chick-fil-A's reputation on being closed on Sundays extends to non-traditional locations. In addition to countless shopping malls and airports, a Chick-fil-A location at Mercedes-Benz Stadium\nin Atlanta will be closed on Sundays despite its main tenant, the Atlanta Falcons\n, playing most of their home games on Sundays. The location will be open when the Falcons have a Monday night\n, Thursday night\nor Saturday home game, as well as non-Sunday home games of Atlanta United FC\nand other events at the stadium. On Sundays, the digital signs will be flipped and concessionaire Levy Restaurants\nwill sell nonbranded food and drinks at the location.[46]\n\n","In January 2011, the media reported that Chick-fil-A was co-sponsoring a marriage conference with the Pennsylvania Family Institute (PFI), an organization that has opposed same-sex marriage\nlegislation.[47]\n\n[48]\n\n[49]\n\n[50]\n\n[51]\n\nChick-fil-A clarified that \"one of our independent Restaurant Operators in Pennsylvania was asked to provide sandwiches to two Art of Marriage video seminars\".[52]\n\nThe WinShape Foundation\n, a charitable organization founded by Truett and his wife, also stated that it would not allow same-sex couples to participate in its marriage retreats.[53]\n\n","Chick-fil-A has donated over $5\u0026#160;million, via WinShape, to groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Of this, more than $3\u0026#160;million was donated primarily to Christian organizations whose agendas included positions that oppose same-sex marriage,[54]\n\nwith the money donated between 2003 and 2009.[55]\n\n[56]\n\n[57]\n\n[58]\n\n[59]\n\n[60]\n\n[61]\n\n[62]\n\nA total of $1.9\u0026#160;million was donated in 2010 to groups such as the Marriage \u0026amp; Family Foundation, Exodus International\n, and the Family Research Council\n(FRC).\"#cite_note-O'Connor-63\"\u003e[63]\n","In June and July 2012, Chick-fil-A's chief operating officer\nDan T. Cathy made several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who \"have the audacity to define what marriage is about\" were \"inviting God's judgment on our nation\".[71]\n\n[72]\n\n[73]\n\n[74]\n\n[75]\n\nSeveral prominent politicians expressed disapproval.[76]\n\nBoston Mayor\nThomas Menino\nand Chicago Alderman\nProco \"Joe\" Moreno\nsaid they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas.[77]\n\n[78]\n\n[79]\n\nThe proposed bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union\n.[80]\n\n[81]\n\n[82]\n\nThe Jim Henson Company\n, which had a Pajanimals\n\nkids' meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay \u0026amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation\n.[83]\n\n[84]\n\n[85]\n\nChick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, claiming that unrelated safety concerns that had arisen prior to the controversy.[86]\n\nChick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying, \"We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\"[87]\n\n","In response to the controversy, former Arkansas\nGovernor Mike Huckabee\ninitiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott\nof Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists.[88]\n\n[89]\n\n[90]\n\nMore than 600,000 people RSVPed on Facebook\nfor Huckabee's appreciation event.[89]\n\nOn August 1, Chick-fil-A restaurants experienced a large show of public support across the nation with the company reporting record-breaking sales.[88]\n\n[89]\n\n[90]\n\nA consulting firm estimated that the average Chick-fil-A restaurant had 29.9 percent more sales and 367 more customers than it did on a typical Wednesday.[18]\n\n","In September 2012, The Civil Rights Agenda\n(TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A had \"ceased donating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against LGBT civil rights.\" Chick-fil-A officials did state in an internal document that they \"will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation.\"[91]\n\nIn a letter from Chick-fil-A's Senior Director of Real Estate, the company states, \"The WinShape Foundation is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas.\"[92]\n\n[93]\n\n","According to Chicago Alderman\nProco \"Joe\" Moreno\n, Chick-fil-A has a statement of respect for all people regardless of sexual orientation\nin an internal document called Chick-fil-A: Who We Are\n. A document released by Chick-fil-A on September 20, 2012, does not mention any organizations opposed to same-sex marriage as being part of Chick-fil-A's donation base. WinShape Marriage will continue to be supported financially, with a stated focus on couple retreats to strengthen marriages.[94]\n\n","According to Focus on the Family\n's website, CitizenLink.com\n, \"Chick-fil-A and its charitable-giving arm, the WinShape Foundation, did not agree to stop making donations to groups that support the Biblical definition of marriage in exchange for being allowed to open a franchise in Chicago.\"[95]\n\nMike Huckabee stated that he \"talked earlier today personally with Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick Fil-A about the new reports that Chick Fil-A had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same sex marriage. This is not true. The company continues to focus on the fair treatment of all of its customers and employees, but to end confusion gave me this statement.\" The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on Huckabee's website.[96]\n\n[97]\n\n","Though Chick-fil-A has always used trans-fat\nfree processes in its chicken sandwiches, anticipating the dietary concerns of consumers, in 2008, it became the first fast-food restaurant to become completely trans-fat free.[98]\n\n","In 2011, food blogger and activist Vani Hari\nwrote a post titled \"Chick-fil-A or Chemical Fil-A?\" on her website, FoodBabe.com. She noted that Chick-fil-A sandwiches contained nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil\nwith TBHQ\n.[99]\n\nIn October 2012, Chick-fil-A invited Hari to meet with company executives at its Atlanta, GA\nheadquarters.[100]\n\nIn December 2013, Chick-fil-A notified Hari that it had eliminated the dye Yellow No. 5\nand had reduced the sodium\ncontent in its chicken soup. The company also said that it is testing a peanut oil that does not contain TBHQ and that it would start testing sauces and dressings made without high-fructose corn syrup\nin 2014.[100]\n\n","According to the Food and Drug Administration\n, antibiotics used in livestock, many of which are also used to treat humans, have contributed to the rise of dangerous bacteria. In December 2012, the FDA announced plans to phase out certain antibiotics in the food production industry.[101]\n\n","In February 2014, Chick-fil-A announced plans to serve chicken raised without antibiotics in its restaurants nationwide within five years.

Coca-Cola employs a diverse range of integrated marketing communications to advertise through direct marketing, web based media, social media, and sales promotions (Stringer, 2015).[40]\n\n","The company carefully considers all touch points a consumer (or prospective consumer) has with the brand as potential delivery channels for the brand's message, and makes use of all relevant communication systems. This well established, long standing, consistent approach has created a longing for the product that by far \"superseded the desire for that typically associated with a drink to quench one's thirst\" (Dudovskiy, 2015).[41]\n\n","They have exclusive vendor company partnerships, which eliminates competition, e.g. cinemas and restaurants only serving Coca-Cola over Pepsi. At sponsored sporting events, they again eliminate competition by attaining sole sale rights as well as VIP sales opportunities to important clients, e.g., baseball fields.","The company also markets via mobile marketing in text messages, e.g. viral marketing campaigns (Stringer, 2015).[40]\n\n","They set the industry benchmark as the brand so universally recognized that audience building is unnecessary. Their fan engagement spans 86 million globally across social media channels. They deliver a consistently unified message whether it be through new products, online interaction, and social, cultural, or sporting events (Stringer, 2015).[40]\n\n","In the retail setting, direct store beverage delivery trucks (mobile advertising) as well as point of sale coolers and vending machines have bright red logo blazoned branding. In terms of food service, Coca-Cola is a food pairing suggestion that is now ingrained as a food match, e.g., for popcorn, burgers, fries, and hot dog combos (Stringer, 2015).[40]\n\n","The Coca-Cola Company offers more than 350 brands in over 200 countries, aside from its namesake Coca-Cola\nbeverage.","Coca-Cola bought Columbia Pictures\nin 1981 owing to the low monetary value of the studio. The film company was the first and only studio ever owned by Coca-Cola. During its ownership of the studio, the studio released many popular films including Ghostbusters\n\n, Stripes\n\n, The Karate Kid\n\n, and some others. However, after the 1987 film Ishtar\n\n, Columbia was sold to Tokyo-based Sony\n.","Coca-Cola operates a soft drink themed tourist attraction in Atlanta, Georgia\n; the World of Coca-Cola\nis a multi-storied exhibition. It features flavor sampling and a history museum, with locations in Las Vegas, Nevada\nand Lake Buena Vista, Florida\n.[42]\n\n[43]\n\n","Tab\nwas Coca-Cola's first attempt to develop a diet soft drink, using saccharin\nas a sugar substitute\n. Introduced in 1963, the product is still sold today, although its sales have dwindled since the introduction of Diet Coke. The Tab soft drink is difficult to locate in recent times, due to its de facto replacement by Diet Coke\n.[44]\n\n","The Coca-Cola Company also produces a number of other soft drinks including Fanta\n(introduced circa 1941) and Sprite\n. Fanta's origins date back to World War II during a trade embargo against Germany on cola syrup, making it impossible to sell Coca-Cola in Germany. Max Keith\n, the head of Coca-Cola's German office during the war, decided to create a new product for the German market, made from products only available in Germany at the time, which they named Fanta.[45]\n\nThe drink proved to be a hit, and when Coke took over again after the war, it adopted the Fanta brand as well. Fanta was originally an orange flavored soft drink which can come in plastic bottles\nor cans. It has become available in many different flavors now such as grape, peach, grapefruit, apple, pineapple, and strawberry.","In 1961, Coca-Cola introduced Sprite\n, a lemon-lime soft drink, and another of the company's bestsellers and its response to 7 Up\n.","Coca-Cola South Africa also released Valpre\nBottled \"still\" and \"sparkling\" water.","In 1969, the company released Simba, which was a take on Mountain Dew, and had packaging that was African desert themed, replete with an African Lion as the symbol of the brand. The tagline was \"Simba - It Cures the African Thirst.\"","Also in 1969, the company released a line of products under the name of Santiba, which was targeted for mixing cocktails and party usage, products including Quinine water and Ginger Ale. Like the above-mentioned Simba, the Santiba line of products was short lived in the marketplace.","No longer manufactured, the Coca-Cola BreakMate was a three-flavour dispenser introduced by Coca-Cola and Siemens\nin 1988. Intended for use in offices with five to fifty people,[46]\n\nits refrigerated compartment held three individual one-litre plastic containers of soda syrup and a CO2\ntank. Like a soda fountain, it mixed syrup in a 1:5 ratio with carbonated water. In North America, Coca-Cola discontinued spare BreakMate parts in 2007 and stopped distributing the syrup in 2010.[47]\n\n","During the 1990s, the company responded to the growing consumer interest in healthy beverages by introducing several new non-carbonated beverage brands. These included Minute Maid\nJuices to Go, Powerade\nsports beverage, flavored tea Nestea\n(in a joint venture with Nestlé\n), Fruitopia\nfruit drink, and Dasani\nwater, among others. In 2001, Minute Maid\ndivision launched the Simply Orange\nbrand of juices including orange juice\n. 2016, Coca-Cola India introduced Vio (flavoured milk)\nto enter into the value added dairy\ncategory, the product lays the foundation for Coca-Cola's new segment after Carbonated beverages\n: Water and Juices.[48]\n\n","In 2004, perhaps in response to the burgeoning popularity of low-carbohydrate diets\nsuch as the Atkins diet\n, Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed C2 Cola\n. C2 contains a mix of high fructose corn syrup\n, aspartame\n, sucralose\n, and Acesulfame potassium\n. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with less than half of the food energy\nand carbohydrates\nof standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke\n. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.","Starting in 2009, The Coca-Cola Company invested in Innocent Drinks\n, first with a minor stake, increasing to 90% in the first quarter of 2013.[49]\n\n","It was in May 2014 when Finley, a sparkling fruit-flavoured drink, was launched in France. It was launched in other countries later,[50]\n\nincluding Belgium\nand Luxembourg\nin September. The drink had first been developed to start by Coca-Cola in 2001 in Belgium.[51]\n\nThe drink is targeted for adults, and is low in sugar with four flavors in 2014.[50]\n\n","Coca-Cola is the best-selling soft drink in most countries, and was recognized as the number one global brand in 2010.[52]\n\nWhile the Middle East is one of the only regions in the world where Coca-Cola is not the number one soda drink, Coca-Cola nonetheless holds almost 25% marketshare (to Pepsi's 75%) and had double-digit growth in 2003.[53]\n\nSimilarly, in Scotland, where the locally produced Irn-Bru\nwas once more popular, 2005 figures show that both Coca-Cola and Diet Coke now outsell Irn-Bru.[54]\n\nIn Peru\n, the native Inca Kola\nhas been more popular than Coca-Cola, which prompted Coca-Cola to enter in negotiations with the soft drink's company and buy 50% of its stakes. In Japan, the best selling soft drink is not cola, as (canned) tea\nand coffee\nare more popular.[55]\n\nAs such, The Coca-Cola Company's best selling brand there is not Coca-Cola, but Georgia\n.[56]\n\nIn May 2016, The Coca-Cola Company temporarily halted production of its signature drink in Venezuela due to sugar shortages.[57]\n\nSince then, The Coca-Cola Company has since been using \"minimum inventories of raw material\" to make their signature drinks at two production plants in Venezuela.[58]\n\n","On July 6, 2006, a Coca-Cola employee and two other people were arrested and charged with trying to sell trade secrets information to the soft drink maker's competitor, PepsiCo\nfor $1.5\u0026#160;million. The recipe for Coca-Cola, perhaps the company's most closely guarded secret, was never in jeopardy. Instead, the information was related to a new beverage in development. Coca-Cola executives verified that the documents were valid and proprietary. At least one glass vial containing a sample of a new drink was offered for sale, court documents said. The conspiracy was revealed by PepsiCo, which notified the authorities when they were approached by the conspirators.[59]\n\n","The company announced a new \"negative calorie\" green tea drink, Enviga\n, in 2006, along with trying coffee retail concepts Far Coast\nand Chaqwa\n.","On May 25, 2007, Coca-Cola announced it would purchase Glaceau\n, a maker of flavored vitamin-enhanced drinks (vitamin water), flavored waters, and Burn\nenergy drinks, for $4.1\u0026#160;billion in cash.[60]\n\n","On September 3, 2008, Coca-Cola announced its intention to make cash offers to purchase China Huiyuan Juice Group Limited\n(which has a 42% share of the Chinese pure fruit juice market[61]\n\n) for US$2.4bn (HK$12.20 per share).[62]\n\nChina's he_People%27s_Republic_of_China\" title=\"Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China\"\u003eministry of commerce\nblocked the deal on March 18, 2009, arguing that the deal would hurt small local juice companies, could have pushed up juice market prices, and limited consumers' choices.[63]\n\n","In October 2009, Coca-Cola revealed its new 90-calorie mini can\nthat holds 7.5 fluid ounces.[64]\n\nThe mini can is often sold in 8 packs. Despite costing nearly 30 percent more per ounce, the mini cans have been met with positive sales figures.[65]\n\n","In November 2011, Coca-Cola revealed a seasonal design for their regular Coke cans as part of a partnership with the World Wildlife Fund. However it was withdrawn only a month after release due to consumer complaints about the similar look to the silver cans commonly used for Diet Coke. There were also complaints about deviating from traditional red as the color of Coca-Cola cans previously.[66]\n\n","It was announced on August 14, 2014, that Coca-Cola Co is making a cash payment of $2.15 billion for a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp\nto expand its market for energy drinks. Coke's ownership in Full Throttle\nand Burn\nwill be transferred to Monster. In return, Monster will transfer its ownership in Hansen's Natural Sodas\nand Peace Iced Tea\nto Coke. Muhtar Kent\n, Coke's Chief Executive Officer, stated that the company has the option to increase its stake to 25 percent but cannot exceed that percentage in the next four years.[67]\n\n[68]\n\n","Coca-Cola's advertising expenses accounted for US$3.256 billion in 2011.[69]\n\n","Coca-Cola sponsored the English Football League\nfrom the beginning of the 2004–05 season\n(beginning August 2004) to the start of 2010/11 season, when the Football League\nreplaced it with NPower\n.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nAlong with this, Coca-Cola sponsored the Coca-Cola Football Camp, that took place in Pretoria, South Africa during the 2010 FIFA World Cup\n, during which hundreds of teenagers from around the world were able to come together and share their love of the game, partly due to Best Buy\n's efforts through their @15 program.[70]\n\n","Other major sponsorships include the AFL\n; NHRA\n; NASCAR\n; the PGA Tour\n; NCAA\nChampionships; the Olympic Games; the NRL\n; the FIFA World Cups\n; and the UEFA European Championships\n.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nEach Fall, Coca-Cola is the sponsor of the TOUR Championship\nby Coca-Cola held at East Lake Golf Club\nin Atlanta, GA\n. The TOUR Championship is the season ending tournament of the PGA TOUR\n.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nIn the Philippines\n, it has a team in the Philippine Basketball Association\n, the Powerade Tigers\n.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","The company sponsored the popular Fox\nsinging-competition series American Idol\n\nfrom 2002 until 2014.[71]\n\n","Coca-Cola is a sponsor of the nightly talk show on PBS\n, Charlie Rose\n\nin the US.[72]\n\n","Coca-Cola are also executive producers of Coke Studio (Pakistan)\n. There are various adaptations of Coke Studio such as Coke Studio (India)\nand Coke Studio (Middle East)\n.","While not necessarily having naming rights to anything in all locations, the company does sponsor and provide beverages in many theme parks, usually in an exclusive capacity. This includes the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts\n,[a]\n\nMerlin Entertainment\n, Universal Parks \u0026amp; Resorts\n, Six Flags\n, Cedar Fair\n, and SeaWorld Entertainment\nwhich are six of the nine largest theme park operators worldwide (it is unknown whether OCT Parks China, the Chimelong Group, or Fantawild, the fourth, seventh, and eighth largest theme park operators respectively, use

The company's history\ncan be traced back to Huff Daland Dusters\n, founded in 1924 in Macon, Georgia\nas a crop dusting\noperation. The company moved to Monroe, Louisiana\n, and was later renamed Delta Air Services\n, in reference to the nearby Mississippi Delta\nregion, and commenced passenger services on June 17, 1929. Among predecessors of today's Delta Air Lines, Western Airlines\nand Northwest Airlines\nbegan flying passengers in 1926 and 1927, respectively.","In 2013, Delta Air Lines was the argest airlines\"\u003eworld's largest airline\nin terms of scheduled passengers carried (120.6 million),[22]\n\nand the second-largest in terms of both revenue passenger-kilometers flown (277.6 billion)[23]\n\nand capacity (4.4 billion ASM\n/week; March 2013).[24]\n\n","","","Delta Air Lines began as a crop dusting\noperation called Huff Daland Dusters, Incorporated. The company was founded on May 30, 1924 in Macon, Georgia, and moved to Monroe, Louisiana, in 1925. They flew a Huff-Daland Duster, the first true crop duster, designed to combat the boll weevil\ninfestation of cotton crops. Collett E. Woolman\n, one of the original directors, purchased the company on September 13, 1928, and renamed it Delta Air Service. Service began on June 17, 1929 with the inaugural flight between Dallas, Texas and Jackson, Mississippi.[25]\n\n","Delta moved its headquarters to its current location in Atlanta in 1941, and continued to grow through the addition of routes and the acquisition of other airlines. It replaced propeller planes with jets in the 1960s and entered international competition to Europe in the 1970s and across the Pacific in the 1980s.","Delta's more recent history is marked by its emergence from bankruptcy\non April 25, 2007, and the subsequent merger with Northwest Airlines\n. The merger was announced April 14, 2008, and was set to create the world's largest airline. After approval of the merger on October 29, 2008, Northwest continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta until December 31, 2009 when both carriers' operating certificates were merged (the Delta certificate was kept).[26]\n\nDelta completed integration with Northwest on January 31, 2010 when their reservation systems\nand websites were combined, and the Northwest Airlines brand was officially retired.[27]\n\n","Delta Air Lines as it exists today is the result of numerous mergers over its history. Predecessor carriers include:","Delta's corporate headquarters is located on a corporate campus on the northern boundary of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, within the city limits of Atlanta.[32]\n\n[33]\n\n[34]\n\nThis location has served as Delta's headquarters since 1941, when the company relocated its corporate offices from Monroe, Louisiana, to Greater Atlanta\n.[35]\n\n[36]\n\nThe crop dusting division of Delta remained headquartered in Monroe until Delta ceased crop dusting in 1966.[37]\n\nPrior to 1981, the Delta corporate campus, an 80-acre (32\u0026#160;ha) plot of land in proximity to the old Hartsfield Airport terminal, was outside the City of Atlanta limits in unincorporated\nFulton County\n. On August 3, 1981 the Atlanta City Council\napproved the annexation of 141 acres (57\u0026#160;ha) of land, an area containing the Delta headquarters. As of 1981 Delta would have had to begin paying $200,000 annually to the City of Atlanta in taxes. In September 1981 the airline sued the city, challenging the annexation on the basis of the constitutionality of the 1960 City of Atlanta annexation of the Hartsfield old terminal.[38]\n\nThe City of Atlanta was only permitted to annex areas that are adjacent to areas already in the Atlanta city limits.[38]\n\n","In addition to hosting Delta's corporate headquarters, Hartsfield-Jackson is also the home of Delta TechOps\n, the airline's primary maintenance, repair and overhaul arm and the largest full-service airline MRO in North America, specializing in engines, components, airframe and line maintenance.[39]\n\n","Delta maintains a large presence in the Twin Cities\n, with over 12,000 employees[40]\n\nin the region as well as significant corporate support functions housed in the Minneapolis area, including the company's information technology divisional offices.[41]\n\n","Delta's logo, often called the \"widget\", was originally unveiled in 1959. Its triangle shape is taken from the Greek letter delta\n, and recalls the airline's origins in the Mississippi Delta\n.[42]\n\nIt is also said to be reminiscent of the swept-wing design of the DC-8\n, Delta's first jet aircraft.[43]\n\n","Delta's current livery\nis called \"Upward \u0026amp; Onward\". It features a white fuselage with the company's name in blue lettering, and a widget on the vertical stabilizer. Delta introduced its current livery in 2007 as part of a re-branding after it emerged from bankruptcy. The new livery consists of four colors, while the old one (called \"colors in motion\") used eight. This meant the switch saved the airline money by removing one day from each aircraft's painting cycle. The airline took four years to repaint all of its aircraft into the current scheme, including aircraft inherited from Northwest Airlines.[42]\n\n","Delta has eight domestic hubs and four international hubs.[12]\n\nDelta carries more passengers than any other airline at Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York–JFK,[44]\n\nNew York–LaGuardia,[44]\n\nand Salt Lake City.","These statistics are current as of February 2017\n. (Ranked by daily departures).[12]\n\n","Between its mainline operation and subsidiaries, and as of March 2015, Delta employs nearly 80,000 people.[12]\n\nJoanne Smith\nis Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer responsible for the oversight and support of personnel needs at Delta. She was appointed on October 1, 2014 replacing Mike Campbell.[58]\n\n","Delta's 12,000 mainline pilots are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International\nand are the union's largest pilot group.[59]\n\n[60]\n\nThe company's approximately 180 flight dispatchers are represented by the Professional Airline Flight Control Association (PAFCA).[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Not counting the pilots and flight dispatchers, Delta is the only one of the five largest airlines in the United States\n, and one of only two in the top 9 (the other being JetBlue), whose non-pilot USA domestic staff is entirely non-union.[59]\n\n","The non-pilot non-unionization caused issues during and after the merger with Northwest, whose employees had a much higher rate of unionization.[59]\n\nWhile pilots at both airlines were unionized, it was necessary to hold unionization votes for all other groups of employees. Northwest Airlines flight attendants\nwere formerly represented by the Association of Flight Attendants\n(AFA).[61]\n\nA vote on unionization with the AFA at the post-merger Delta was held on November 3, 2010, unionization was narrowly rejected by flight attendants, with 9,544 votes against unionization and 9,216 in favor.[61]\n\n[62]\n\nThe AFA accused Delta of interference in the vote and requested the National Mediation Board\n(NMB) investigate and order a second vote.[59]\n\nThe NMB investigation found that the election was not compromised and dismissed the claim.[63]\n\nCurrently[when?\n\n\n]\nboth the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers\nand a coalition of the AFA and the Transport Workers Union of America\nare seeking to hold unionization votes for Delta flight attendants.[64]\n\n[65]\n\n[66]\n\n[obsolete\u0026#160;source\n\n\n]\n","Further information: Delta Air Lines destinations\nand Delta Connection destinations\n","As of March 2015, Delta operates more than 5,400 flights per day. Delta Connection operates 2,533 daily flights.[12]\n\n","Delta is the only U.S. carrier that is flying to Accra\n, Copenhagen\n, Dakar\n, Düsseldorf\n, Johannesburg\n, Lagos\n, \n, Prague\n(sesasonal), Reykjavik\n(seasonal), and Stuttgart\n. It is also the only U.S. carrier that has scheduled service to Africa.","Delta was a founding member of the SkyTeam Alliance\nin 2000. In addition to SkyTeam partners, Delta Air Lines also has codeshare agreements\nwith the following airlines:[67]\n\n[68]\n\n","Inherited from the Northwest-KLM relationship (which is older than any of the three major airline alliances\nincluding SkyTeam itself), Delta has a transatlantic joint venture with Air France-KLM\nand Alitalia\n. The program coordinates transatlantic operations, including ticket pricing, schedules, capacity, and revenue.[70]\n\nOn January 27, 2012, the European Commission launched an investigation into the impact of the joint venture on competition\non the routes that it covers.[70]\n\n","On December 11, 2012, Delta announced that it would spend $360 million to acquire a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic\n. These shares were previously held by Singapore Airlines. As a part of this agreement, both airlines would share the costs and revenues from all of the joint venture flights the airlines operated. The two airlines planned to operate a total of 31 roundtrip flights between the UK and North America, including nine daily roundtrip flights between London Heathrow\nand New York City airports (John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport\n).[71]\n\nThe two airlines' application for antitrust immunity was granted by the United States Department of Transportation\non September 23, 2013.[72]\n\n","As of February\u0026#160;2018[update]\n\n, Delta operates a fleet of more than 850 aircraft manufactured by Airbus\n, Boeing\n, and McDonnell Douglas\n.[12]\n\nDelta operates the largest Boeing 717\n, Boeing 757\n, Boeing 767\n, McDonnell Douglas MD-88\n, and McDonnell Douglas MD-90\nfleets in the world, and the largest Airbus A330\nfleet of any US airline. Prior to its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, Delta's fleet was made up of solely Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft. Airbus aircraft from Northwest joined the fleet after the merger, and more have since been added.","Unlike other U.S. legacy carriers, Delta often seeks to acquire and utilize older aircraft, especially narrow-bodies, and it has created an extensive MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) organization, called TechOps, to support them. The oldest aircraft in the fleet are the McDonnell Douglas MD-88s, with an average age of over 25 years.[15]\n\nHowever, in early 2011, Delta began talks with Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier\nto discuss replacing the McDonnell Douglas DC-9s\n, MD-88s, and older A320 and 757-200 aircraft.[73]\n\nOn August 22, 2011, Delta placed an order for 100 Boeing 737-900ER\naircraft[74]\n\nand deferred an order of 100 small narrow-body jets until 2012.[75]\n\n","As part of its strategy to utilize less expensive used airplanes, Delta agreed in 2012 to lease 88 Boeing 717s acquired by Southwest Airlines\nduring their acquisition of AirTran Airways\n.[76]\n\nThey would be used as replacements for the DC-9 fleet and some 50-seat regional aircraft like the CRJ-100 and -200\n.[77]\n\nThe first revenue flight was on October 25, 2013,[78]\n\nDelta officially retired its last DC-9 on January 6, 2014; it was used on an as-needed basis until January 22, 2014 when the last one was removed from service.[79]\n\n[80]\n\nDelta was the final US carrier operating the DC-9.[81]\n\nAs a continuation of the narrowbody fleet refresh and expansion, Delta ordered 75 Bombardier CS100\naircraft and an additional 50 options on April 28, 2016, becoming the first American carrier to order the type.[82]\n\n","The airline has not been as keen to acquire or operate aging widebody aircraft. On August 1, 2014, Delta announced they would begin to retire their aging Boeing 747-400\nfleet, which Delta acquired as part of the Northwest merger.[83]\n\nDuring a 2014 earnings call, CEO Richard Anderson\nannounced that they would be retired by the end of 2017.[84]\n\nOn November 20, 2014, the airline announced an order for 25 Airbus A350-900\nand 25 Airbus A330-900\naircraft to replace the 747 fleet as it was retired, as well as some aging 767s. A350 deliveries began in the second quarter of 2017, while the first A330-900 is scheduled for 2019.[85]\n\n[86]\n\nDelta retired the 747 in January 3, 2018 with its final revenue flight with the 747 taken place form Seoul-Incheon to Detroit on December 19, 2017, becoming the last major U.S. airline to fly the 747.[87]\n\n[88]\n\n","On December 14, 2017, Delta ordered 100 Airbus A321neos\n, with 100 further options for $25.4 billion at list prices, to be delivered from 2020 to 2023; equipped with Pratt \u0026amp; Whitney PW1100Gs\nand seating 197, they will replace aging Airbus A320s\n, Boeing 757-200s\nand MD-90s\n.[89]\n\n","Delta underwent a cabin branding upgrade in 2015.[90]\n\nThe airline now offers or plans to offer 6 different cabin service options: Delta One, Delta Premium Select, First Class, Comfort+, Main Cabin, and Basic Economy. Availability and exact details vary by route and aircraft type.","Delta One is the airline's premier business class\nproduct, being available on long haul international flights, as well as transcontinental\nservice from New York-JFK\nto Los Angeles\nand San Francisco\n.[90]\n\n","Delta One features lie-flat seating on all aircraft types, and direct aisle access from every seat on all types except the Boeing 757-200\n. The Boeing 767-300ER\nand Boeing 767-400ER\nseats, designed by James Thompson\n, feature a space-saving design whereby the seats are staggered such that when in the fully flat position, the foot of each bed extends under the armrests of the seat in front of it. Delta one cabins on the Boeing 777-200ER\n/LR\nfleet are configured in a Herringbone\nlayout, while Airbus A330\ncabins (featuring the Cirrus\nflat-bed sleeper suite by Zodiac Seats U.S.\n) are configured in a reverse herringbone pattern.[91]\n\n","All seats are also equipped with a personal, on demand In-Flight-Entertainment (IFE) system, universal power-ports, a movable reading light, and a folding work table. Passengers also receive complimentary chef-curated meals, refreshments, alcoholic beverages, an amenity kit, premium bedding, and pre-flight Sky Club access.[92]\n\n","In August 2016, Delta announced the introduction of Delta One Suites on select widebody fleets. The suites will feature a door to the aisle for enhanced privacy, as well as improved storage space, a larger IFE screen, and updated design. The suites will roll out on the Airbus A350\nfleet, first delivered in July 2017, followed by installation within the Boeing 777 fleet.[93]\n\n[94]\n\n","In April 2016, CEO Ed Bastian announced that a new Premium Economy cabin will be added. Since renamed to Premium Select, this cabin will feature extra legroom, adjustable leg rests, extra seat pitch, width, and recline, and a new premium service. Delta introduced it on its new Airbus A350\n, first delivered in Fall 2017, and will be followed by the Boeing 777\n.[95]\n\n","First Class is offered on mainline domestic flights (except those featuring Delta One service), select short- and medium-haul international flights, and Delta Connection aircraft with more than 50 seats. Seats range from 18.5 to 20.75 inches (47.0 to 52.7\u0026#160;cm) wide and have between 37 and 40 inches (94 and 102\u0026#160;cm) of pitch. Passengers in this class receive a wider variety of free snacks compared to Main Cabin, as well as free drinks and alcohol, and full meal service on flights 900 miles and longer. Certain aircraft also feature power-ports at each seat and free entertainment products from Delta Studio. First Class passengers are also eligible for priority boarding.[92]\n\n","Delta Comfort+ seats are installed on all aircraft and feature 34–36 inches (860–910\u0026#160;mm) of pitch; on all Delta One configured aircraft, 35–36 inches (890–910\u0026#160;mm) of pitch and 50 percent more recline over standard Main Cabin seats.[96]\n\nAdditional amenities include: Sky Priority Boarding, dedicated overhead space, complimentary beer, wine, and spirits on flight 250 miles or more, and complimentary premium snacks on flights 900 miles or more. Complimentary premium entertainment is available via Delta Studio, with free headsets available on most flights.[92]\n\nOn transcontinental flights between JFK-LAX/SFO, Delta Comfort+ passengers also get Luvo\nsnack wraps. Medallion members can upgrade from Main Cabin to Comfort+ for free, while other customers can upgrade for a fee or with SkyMiles.[97]\n\n","Main Cabin is available on all aircraft with seats ranging from 17 to 18 inches (43 to 46\u0026#160;cm) wide and 30 to 33 inches (76 to 84\u0026#160;cm) of pitch. The main cabin on Boeing 737, 747-400, 777, and selected Boeing 757-200, 767-300, and McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft have an articulating seat bottom where the seat bottom moves forward in addition to the seat back tilting backwards when reclining.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n[98]\n\n","Main Cabin passengers receive complimentary snacks and non-alcoholic drinks on all flights 250 miles (400\u0026#160;km) or longer. Alcoholic beverages are also available for purchase. Complimentary meals and alcoholic drinks are provided on long-haul international flights as well as selected transcontinental domestic flights, such as between New York–JFK and Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego.[99]\n\n[100]\n\nAs part of Delta's Flight Fuel buy on board\nprogram, meals are available for purchase on other North American flights 900 miles (1,400\u0026#160;km) or longer.[99]\n\n","Delta operated a different buy on board program between 2003 and 2005.[101]\n\n[102]\n\nThe previous program had items from differing providers, depending on the origin and destination of the flight.[103]\n\n[104]\n\nPrices ranged up to $10 ($12.96 when adjusted for inflation). The airline started the service on a few selected flights in July 2003, and the meal service was initially offered on 400 flights.[105]\n\nDelta ended this buy on board program in 2005; instead, Delta began offering snacks at no extra charge on flights over 90 minutes to most U.S. domestic flights and some flights to the Caribbean and Latin America. Beginning in mid-March 2005 the airline planned to stop providing pillows on flights within the 48 contiguous U.S. states, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, and Central America. In addition, the airline increased the price of alcoholic beverages on Delta mainline flights from $4 ($5.01 when adjusted for inflation) to $5 ($6.27 when adjusted for inflation); the increase in alcohol prices did not occur on Song flights.[105]\n\n","Basic Economy is a basic version of Main Cabin, offering the same services with fewer flexibility options for a lower price.[90]\n\nExamples of fewer flexibility options include no ticket changes, no paid or complimentary upgrades regardless of frequent-flier status, and only having a seat assigned at check-in.[106]\n\n","On August 5, 2008, Delta announced it would be installing the Aircell\nmobile broadband network, Gogo\n, which enables customers traveling with Wi-Fi enabled devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets, to access the Internet for a fee. Gogo was initially offered on Delta's fleet of McDonnell Douglas MD-88 and MD-90 aircraft but has expanded to the remaining domestic fleet, as well as Delta Connection aircraft with a first class cabin.[107]\n\n[108]\n\nDelta has the largest fleet of Wi-Fi-equipped aircraft in the world.[109]\n\nThe airline introduced its first in-flight Wi-Fi on international routes to Tokyo from Los Angeles and Atlanta in March 2014, and stated its intent to offer the service on all transoceanic flight routes by the end of 2015.[110]\n\nEven though Delta has announced the retirement of its 747 fleet, all Delta 747s are wifi-equipped and Delta is currently installing wifi on the 777\nfleet.[111]\n\n","In the 1960s audio programming was introduced where passengers wore headphones consisting of hollow tubes piping in music. These were installed in some Delta aircraft. Some early wide-bodied aircraft, including the Lockheed L-1011\n, Boeing 767-200\n, and 767-300\nfleet, had movies projected on to the cabin bulkhead. Also during the late 1980s and early 1990s, CRT monitors over the aisles were added to the 757 fleet, making them the first narrowbody aircraft to feature video entertainment. The MD-90 introduced Delta's first IFE system with LCD\nmonitors in 1995, and the 777 introduced Delta's first in-seat video system in 1999, initially using the Rockwell Collins\nTotal Entertainment System. Delta's first all-digital IFE system with AVOD (Panasonic eFX) was first introduced in 2003 on Delta's former low-cost subsidiary, Song. The Rockwell Collins IFE system on the 777s was replaced by the Panasonic eFX system in 2007, followed by the Panasonic eX2 in 2011. The Panasonic eFX and eX2 systems are trademarked by Delta as Delta on Demand\n.[112]\n\n","In the spring of 2010, Delta installed the Panasonic eFX AVOD system in Economy on six 767-300ERs that are used on routes that are 12 hours or longer.[113]\n\nDelta also announced it would be installing AVOD in Economy class on all Boeing 767-300ER and 747 aircraft over the next 3 years.[114]\n\n","On July 27, 2010, Delta announced that it would be the launch customer of the new eX2 AVOD system with the Eco 9i Integrated Smart Monitor, a new ultra-lightweight IFE system by Panasonic Avionics Corporation and Zodiac Seats U.S.\n.[115]\n\nThe systems have been installed on the entire 747-400 fleet as of October 2012, and are currently being installed on the 767-300ER fleet (except for the six aircraft previously retrofitted with the eFX system in 2010).[116]\n\nA different version of the Integrated Smart Monitor developed by Panasonic Avionics Corporation and BE Aerospace\nis currently being installed on the Airbus A330 fleet. These seats will also be installed on the Boeing 757-300 and new Boeing 737-900ER fleet, and will replace the existing seats and monitors on the international Boeing 757-200 fleet.","In 2012, Delta began replacing the overhead CRT monitors on the pre-merger Delta 757-200 fleet with new LCD monitors.[117]\n\nThis was completed in late 2012.","The 767-400ER fleet initially featured LCDs over the aisles, but were replaced in 2009 by the Panasonic eFX AVOD system when the last of the 767-400ERs were converted from domestic to international use. CRT projectors were originally featured in economy class on Boeing 767–300s\n, with the international 767-300ERs also featuring ceiling-mounted CRT displays over the aisles, which have since replaced by LCD monitors, and are now in the process of being converted to the eFX2 AVOD system.","When Delta's ex-TWA\nETOPS\n757s were first delivered, they featured a system made by Sony Transcom (a former subsidiary of Sony\nnow sold to Rockwell Collins\n) system that was factory installed for TWA. The system featured overhead drop-down LCD\nmonitors similar to Delta's non-Transcon 737-800s and 757-300s. Delta replaced the Sony Transcom system with the Panasonic eFX system featuring in-seat video and AVOD at the same time as the new BusinessElite seats and slimline economy class seats were installed.[118]\n\n","Audio and video are available on all aircraft except for the McDonnell Douglas MD-80\nand MD-90, select Airbus A320\n, and Delta Connection aircraft. Boeing 777-200ER\n, 777-200LR\n, along with 767-300 and A330 aircraft that have completed cabin modifications, feature the Panasonic eX2 system. Compared to the older eFX system, this offers greater storage capacity, as well as lighter and larger personal video screens.[119]\n\nBoeing 767-400ER\naircraft, selected 757-200 aircraft, as well as the remaining internationally configured Boeing 767-300ER\naircraft that have not completed cabin modifications, use the Panasonic\neFX AVOD system. On these 767-300 aircraft, AVOD is available only in the Delta One class, while the system includes overhead LCD monitors and audio programming for passengers seated in the Economy cabin. The unmodified Airbus A330 aircraft feature the Panasonic 3000i AVOD\nsystem in all cabins.[120]\n\nThis system includes supplemental LCD monitors over the aisles for displaying the safety video and moving map.","Domestic Boeing 767–300s\n, Boeing 737–700s\n, as well as selected transcontinental Boeing 757–200s\nand selected Boeing 737–800s\nusing the Panasonic eFX system, also feature live television via Dish Network\nin both first class and economy. Some Boeing 737-800s\n, as well as all Boeing 757–300s\nfeature systems with drop-down LCD displays below the overhead bins.[121]\n\n","All aircraft with AVOD feature Panasonic's iXplor moving map program. 737-800s with overhead video and the coach sections of 767-300ER aircraft with overhead video feature the Rockwell Collins Airshow moving map, which is often shown during takeoff and landing. Other aircraft formerly equipped with the Rockwell Collins Airshow moving map included the Lockheed L-1011-250 and -500, McDonnell Douglas MD-11\n, and Boeing 767-400ER\nand 777-200ER\n. The L-1011 and MD-11 fleet have since been retired, while the 767-400ER and 777-200ER have since had their Airshow systems replaced by the Panasonic iXplor system built into the eFX and eX2 AVOD systems.","Delta Sky Magazine\nand its online edition are published by MSP Communications in Minneapolis, Minnesota.","SkyMiles is the frequent flyer program\nfor Delta Air Lines. As of September 2017, one of the features of the program is that miles never expire.","Delta Air Lines' airport lounges are called Sky Clubs.[122]\n\nMembership options include single visit passes and annual memberships that can be purchased with either money or miles. International business class passengers get free access. Membership can also be granted through top level Delta status or with the purchase of some American Express credit cards.","Features vary by location, but generally include free drinks (including alcoholic beverages), snacks and reading material. Wi-Fi is free for members and guests and is mostly provided in the USA by AT\u0026amp;T. Other benefits for Sky Club members include reciprocal lounge access with other SkyTeam members and Delta's other partners.[123]\n\n","Originally, Delta's membership-based airport clubs were called Crown Room lounges, with Northwest's called WorldClubs.","On November 27, 2001, Delta Air Lines launched SkyBonus,[124]\n\n[not in citation given\n\n\n]\na program aimed toward small-to-medium businesses spending between $5,000 and $500,000 annually on air travel.[125]\n\nBusinesses can earn points toward free travel and upgrades, as well as Sky Club memberships and SkyMiles Silver Medallion status. Points are earned on paid travel based on a variety of fare amount paid, booking code, and place origin or destination.[126]\n\nWhile enrolled businesses are able to earn points toward free travel, the travelling passenger is still eligible to earn SkyMiles during his or her travel.[126]\n\n","In early 2010, Delta Air Lines merged its SkyBonus program with Northwest's similar Biz Perks program.[126]\n\n","In 2008, Delta Air Lines was given an award from the United States Environmental Protection Agency\n's Design for the Environment (DfE) program for their use of PreKote, a more environmentally friendly, non-hexavalent chromium surface pretreatment on its aircraft, replacing hazardous chemicals formerly used to improve paint adhesion and prevent corrosion. In addition, PreKote reduces water usage by two-thirds and reduces wastewater treatment.","PreKote is also saving money by reducing the time needed to paint each airplane. With time savings of eight to ten percent, it will save an estimated more than $1 million annually.[127]\n\n","As part of the rebranding project, a safety video\nfeaturing a flight attendant showed up on YouTube in early 2008, getting over 1 million views and the attention of news outlets, specifically for the video's tone mixed with the serious safety message. The flight attendant, Katherine Lee, was dubbed \"Deltalina\" by a member of FlyerTalk for her resemblance to Angelina Jolie\n.[149]\n\n[150]\n\n[151]\n\n[152]\n\nDelta had considered several styles for its current safety video, including animation, before opting for a video presenting a flight attendant speaking to the audience. The video was filmed on a Boeing 757.[153]\n\n","The following are major accidents and incidents\nthat occurred on Delta mainline aircraft. For Northwest Airlines incidents, see Northwest Airlines accidents and incidents\n. For Delta Connection incidents, see Delta Connection incidents and accidents\n.","There have been over a dozen attempted hijackings that resulted in no injuries and the surrender of the often lone hijacker. These incidents are not included. The following are notable hijackings because of fatalities or success in forcing the aircraft to fly to another country:"],"title":"Delta Air

ExpressJet flew to 5 cities from Frontier's Denver hub using 50-seat ERJ 145 regional jets until Frontier's subsidiary, Lynx Aviation, received DOT approval in December 2007. As of December 7, ExpressJet discontinued providing feeder service for Frontier Airlines.[18]\n\n","On August 21, 2009, an incident occurred where passengers were forced to stay on a parked plane at Rochester, Minnesota\nfor six hours with no food and overflowing toilets. The airline crew tried over thirty times to call the contract carrier, Delta Connection, (which services the Rochester airport) to let the passengers off. The agents for the regional Mesaba Airlines\nrefused. The Department of Transportation cited the main cause of the incident as the Mesaba Airlines station's refusal to park the aircraft.[19]\n\nHowever, Continental Airlines\nand ExpressJet were also fined for the part they played in the incident.","ExpressJet began a temporary contract with United Airlines\nto fly as a United Express\ncarrier beginning in June 2009. The contract was for approximately 10 aircraft that operated out of United's O'Hare and Washington (Dulles) hub. The aircraft were flown in ExpressJet livery. The contract ended on September 2, 2009.","In late 2010 ExpressJet signed a multiple year contract with United Airlines for 22 ERJ-145 aircraft. The aircraft were flown, for the first time, in full United Express colors. Additionally, 10 more ERJ-145s; in ExpressJet colors, operated for United during the peak Summer travel season in 2010. The first flights under this new contract started December 1, 2009 and all 22 aircraft were in United Express service by Spring 2010.","In May 2010, ExpressJet began operating Branson AirExpress\n, non-stop air service between Branson, Missouri\nand Houston, Texas\n; Austin, Texas\n; Nashville, Tennessee\n; Des Moines, Iowa\n; Shreveport, Louisiana\nand Terre Haute, Indiana\n; Chicago Midway\nand Indianapolis\n.[20]\n\n[21]\n\nExpressJet last flight operating under Branson Air Express was on Oct 30 2010.","ExpressJet operated its own point-to-point service with its main hub at LA/Ontario International Airport\nin Ontario, California\n. This service ended on September 2, 2008.","In April 2008, SkyWest, Inc.\nproposed an acquisition of ExpressJet at a price of $3.50/share. ExpressJet Holdings Inc. said its special committee unanimously rejected the proposal. SkyWest rescinded the offer in early June after ExpressJet Holdings and Continental signed a new 7-year Capacity Purchase Agreement. This proposal was ultimately not successful.","On November 12, 2010, the financial transaction between Atlantic Southeast Airlines\n(a subsidiary of SkyWest, Inc.\n) and ExpressJet was closed. Thus as a legal entity the original (legacy) ExpressJet airlines effectively ceased to exist. Atlantic Southeast Airlines continued to operate ExpressJet during that time under the terms of their then current operating certificate with the FAA as \"ExpressJet Airlines\" while a new name for the recently merged companies was being considered.","In October 2011, the employees of ExpressJet and Atlantic Southeast Airlines voted to keep the name ExpressJet as the combined airlines new name, while Atlantic Southeast's \"Acey\" callsign would remain.[22]\n\n","In October 2013, ExpressJet opened a new crew domicile in Kansas City, Missouri\n, at Kansas City International Airport\n.[23]\n\nExpressJet also opened a crew domicile in Denver, at Denver International Airport.","In March 2015, the Washington-Dulles crew domicile closed and Dallas-FT. Worth opened as a crew domicile for the Embraer 145 fleet. ExpressJet started to take delivery of 15 EMB-145 aircraft that were previously operated by Envoy.","In April 2015, the Denver Crew was closed and the imminent closure of the MCI domicile was announced.","In June 2017, the Shreveport maintenance base was closed.","ExpressJet currently has crew bases in Atlanta, Chicago-O'Hare, Cleveland, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Houston-Intercontinental, Newark, and New York-LaGuardia.

The company acquired its first West Coast facility in 1947 and changed its name to Georgia-Pacific Plywood \u0026amp; Lumber Company in 1948. In 1956, the company changed its name to Georgia-Pacific Corporation. In 1957 the company entered the pulp and paper business by building a kraft pulp\nand linerboard\nmill at Toledo, Oregon\n. The company continued to make a series of acquisitions, including US Plywood\nin 1987, Great Northern Nekoosa\n\nin 1990, and the Fort James Corporation\n\nin 2000.

Georgia Pacific is contributing to dam removal work as part of an effort to clean up PCB contamination in Kalamazoo.[7]\n\n","Each year the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA) requires Georgia-Pacific, as it does all large manufacturers, to report publicly quantities of certain chemicals that facilities release into the air, water, and onto land. For the 2006 period (as of Spring 2008) – the company showed a 12 percent decrease in these releases from 2005.

Another settlement required an additional $15,000,000 of environmental work on the Kalamazoo River Superfund Site\n.[9]\n\n","Georgia-Pacific is the largest user of de-ink fiber\nin the world, and its subsidiary company GP Harmon\ntrades in the recycled material. The company has expanded into other markets in countries like Mexico and China. In 2005, president of the division Simon Davies estimated that China would require the import of scrap paper from the US and elsewhere for at least 15 years. In the long run, he asserted, the growth of the Chinese middle class\nwould be correlated with a large increase in paper production, and having viable paper recovery systems in place would be of great value to them.[10]\n\n","In 2009, the EPA awarded Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific its SmartWay Excellence award, \"an innovative collaboration between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the freight industry designed to increase energy efficiency while significantly reducing air pollution,\" and specifically commended Georgia-Pacific. The award states:","In, 2008, 93% of Georgia-Pacific's freight was hauled by SmartWay Transport Partners, an increase of 47% over the previous year. Of the 145 carriers Georgia-Pacific uses, 104 were SmartWay carriers, an increase of 33% over 2007. In 2008, Georgia-Pacific experienced tremendous growth in its intermodal shipping. Georgia-Pacific was able to work with its customers to increase lead-time and create more intermodal freight shipments without significantly impacting customer's needs, thus increasing intermodal loads by 39% in 2008 as compared to 2007. Georgia-Pacific uses advanced software to pack loads more efficiently and increase cube utilization in its trailers. The company also reduced empty loads by 10%, increased utilization of local fleets, and established an idling reduction policy in place at its 12 distribution centers. In the summer of 2008, Georgia Pacific held a fuel conservation summit to explore ways for shippers and carriers to work together to further reduce fuel consumption from its freight transport operations.[11]\n\n","In 2010, Georgia-Pacific, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, donated 682 acres (2.76\u0026#160;km2\n) near Wauna, Oregon\n, to The Nature Conservancy\n.[12]\n\n","The Georgia-Pacific Foundation Scholarship Program for Employees' Children has awarded nearly $10.5 million in college scholarships to children of the company's employees between 1988 and 2013.

The Georgia Power Building\n, its primary corporate office building\n, is located at 241 Ralph McGill\nBoulevard in downtown Atlanta\n.","In 2006 the Savannah Electric \u0026amp; Power Company\n, a separate subsidiary\nof Southern Company, was merged into Georgia Power.","","","Originally the Georgia Railway and Power Company\n, it began in 1902 as a company running the streetcars in Atlanta\n, and was the successor\nto the Atlanta Consolidated Street Railway Company\n. In the 1930s, the company published a free newsletter called Two Bells\nwhich was distributed on its streetcars; Two Bells was still distributed into the 1960s on the buses of successor Atlanta Transit Company\n(ATC). [5]\n\nFrom 1937 until 1950, Georgia Power also operated trolleybuses in Atlanta\n, and in 1950 its network of 31 electric bus routes was the largest trolley bus\nsystem in the United States.[6]\n\nAfter the Atlanta transit strike of 1950\n, the Atlanta Transit Company took over operations. Atlanta Streetcar\nwas formed in the 2000s to establish a new streetcar\nservice along Peachtree Street\n.","The company built several dams\n, including the Morgan Falls Dam\njust north of the city, and some as far away as the Tallulah River\nin the northeast Georgia mountains\n. These hydroelectric\ndams form Lake Burton\n, Lake Seed\n, Lake Rabun\n, Lake Tallulah Falls\n, Lake Tugalo\n, and Lake Yonah, the last two of which straddle the Georgia – South Carolina\nborder on the Tugaloo River\n.","The 2016 Delta Air Lines power outage\nis an event that occurred in the United States[7]\n\nin which hundreds of Delta Air Lines\nflights\nwere delayed\nor cancelled\n.[8]\n\nThough it was initially suspected that the company was at fault, it was later determined that this was indeed not the case.[9]\n\n","Georgia Power operates the Robert W. Scherer Power Plant, also known as \"Plant Scherer,\" in Monroe County, Georgia\n. According to Natural History Magazine\n\n, as of 2006[update]\n\nPlant Scherer is the largest single point-source for carbon dioxide\nemissions\nin the United States.[10]\n\nIt was also ranked the 20th in the world in terms of carbon dioxide emissions by the Center for Global Development\non its list of global power plants in November 2007. It was the only power plant in the United States that was listed in the world's top 25 Carbon Dioxide producers.[11]\n\n","Georgia Power utilizes transmission lines carrying 115,000 volts, 230,000 volts and 500,000 volts. Georgia Power has interconnections with the Tennessee Valley Authority\nto the north, sister company Alabama Power\nto the west, South Carolina Electric and Gas\nand Duke Energy\nto the east, and Gulf Power\n(another sister company), Florida Power \u0026amp; Light\n, Progress Energy Florida\nand the city of Tallahassee, Florida\nto the south.","Georgia Power asked the state's public service commission for approval to convert the coal-fired Plant Mitchell to run on wood fuel. If approved, the retrofit\nwould have begun in 2011 and the biomass plant would have started operating in mid-2012. The 96\u0026#160;MW\n(129,000\u0026#160;hp\n) biomass plant would have run on surplus wood from suppliers within a 100\u0026#160;mi (160\u0026#160;km) radius of the plant, which is located near Albany, Georgia\n. However, in 2014, the company announced it was decertifying the plant and intended to close its operations by April 2015.","Georgia Power owns and operates a total of 46 generating plants which include hydroelectric dams, fossil fueled generating plants and nuclear power plants, which provide electricity to more than 2.4 million customers in all but four of Georgia's counties.[12]\n\n","Georgia Power Hydro incorporates 19 hydro electric generating units to produce a generation capacity of 1,087,536 kilowatts\n(KW).

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94debc0262df3aa1b2f556"},"content":{"contents":["Holiday Inn\nis a British-owned American brand of hotels\n, and a subsidiary of InterContinental Hotels Group\n. Founded as a U.S. motel\nchain, it has grown to be one of the world's largest hotel chains, with 1,145 active hotels as of September\u0026#160;30, 2016[update]\n\n.[3]\n\n[4]\n\nThe hotel chain is based in Denham, Buckinghamshire\n.","","","Kemmons Wilson\n, a resident of Memphis, Tennessee\n, was inspired to build his own motel after being disappointed by poor quality and inconsistent roadside accommodation during a family road trip\nto Washington, D.C.\nThe name \"Holiday Inn\" was coined by Wilson's architect Eddie Bluestein as a joke during construction of the first hotel, in reference to the 1942 Christmas\n-themed, musical film\nHoliday Inn\n\n, starring Bing Crosby\nand Fred Astaire\n. Their first hotel/motel opened in August 1952 as \"Holiday Inn Hotel Courts\" at 4925 Summer Avenue in Memphis, the main highway to Nashville.\nIn the early 1990s it was demolished, leaving behind a plaque\ncommemorating the site.","Wilson partnered with Wallace E. Johnson to build additional motels\non the roads entering Memphis.[5]\n\nAt the time Holiday Inn's corporate headquarters was in a converted plumbing shed owned by Johnson. In 1953, the company built its next three hotels which, along with their first hotel, covered the roads that led to Memphis. The second motel was built on U.S. 51 South\n. It was followed by two more in 1953, one on Highway 51 North, and another on U.S. 61\n. Upon Johnson's death in 1988, Wilson was quoted as saying, \"The greatest man I ever knew died today. He was the greatest partner a man could ever have.\" What they started together, with Wilson later helming the project, became the Holiday Corporation, one of the world's largest hotel groups.","By the beginning of 1956, there were 23 Holiday Inns operating with seven more due to open by the year's end. In 1957, Wilson began marketing the chain as \"Holiday Inn of America\", mandating its properties be standardized, clean, predictable, family-friendly, and readily accessible to road travelers. The chain grew dramatically as a result, with 50 locations across the country by 1958, 100 by 1959, 500 by 1964, and the 1,000th Holiday Inn (in San Antonio\n, Texas\n) opening in 1968.","In 1965, the chain launched Holidex, a centralized reservation system where a visitor to any Holiday Inn could obtain reservations, by teleprinter\n, for any other Holiday Inn location. The only comparable systems at the time were operated by airlines (Sabre\nmade its debut in 1963). Promoting itself as \"your host from coast to coast\", Holiday Inn added a call center after AT\u0026amp;T's introduction of +1-800 toll-free telephone number\nservice in 1967, and updated its systems as desktop microcomputers\n, an invention of the 1970s, found their way into travel agencies\n.[6]\n\n","Branded as \"The Nation's Innkeeper\", the chain put considerable financial pressure on traditional motels and hotels, setting the standard for competitors like Ramada Inn\n, Quality Inn\n, ohnson's\"\u003eHoward Johnson's\n, and Best Western\n. By June 1972, with over 1,400 Holiday Inns worldwide, Wilson was featured on the cover of Time\n\nmagazine and the franchise's motto became \"The World's Innkeeper\".","In the 1960s, Holiday Inn began franchising and opening campgrounds\nunder the Holiday Inn Trav-L-Park\nbrand. These recreational campgrounds were listed in the Holiday Inn directories.[7]\n\n[8]\n\n","In 1963, Holiday Inn signed a long-term deal with Gulf Oil Corporation\nwhere it agreed to accept Gulf credit cards to charge food and lodging at all of its American and Canadian hotels, in return for Gulf building service stations\non many Holiday Inn properties, particularly near major U.S. and Interstate highways. The arrangement was copied by competing lodging chains and major oil companies during the mid-to-late 1960s, but fell out of favor following the 1973 oil crisis\n. The Gulf/Holiday Inn arrangement ended around 1982.","In 1971, the company constructed the Holiday Inn University and Conference Center, a teaching hotel for training new employees, in Olive Branch, Mississippi\n. In 1973, the company built the Olive Branch Airport\nnorth of the University as a home base for its corporate aircraft.","The company later branched into other enterprises, including Medi-Center nursing homes, Continental Trailways\n, Delta Queen\n, and Show-Biz, Inc., a television production company that specialized in syndicated\ncountry music\nshows. Wilson also developed the Orange Lake Resort and Country Club near Orlando\nand a chain called Wilson World Hotels. The acquisition of Trailways\nin 1968 lasted until 1979, when Holiday Inn sold Trailways to private investor Henry Lea Hillman Sr\nof Pittsburgh\n, Pennsylvania. In the years during which Trailways was a subsidiary of Holiday Inn, television commercials for Holiday Inn frequently showed a Trailways bus stopping at a Holiday Inn hotel. Wilson retired from Holiday Inn in 1979. As of 2014, Wilson's family still operates hotels as part of the Kemmons Wilson Companies of Memphis.","The \"Great Sign\" was the roadside sign used by Holiday Inn during its original era of expansion from the 1950s to 1970s. It was perhaps the company's most successful form of advertising. It was extremely large and eye-catching, but was expensive to construct and operate. The manufacturer of the sign was Balton \u0026amp; Sons Sign Company, and it was originally designed by sketch artists Gene Barber and Roland Alexander. Wilson wanted a prominent sign, desiring that it be at least 50 feet (15\u0026#160;m) high and visible in both directions. He also wanted a changeable marquee to welcome different groups. The original sign cost $13,000.[9]\n\nIt is said that the sign's colors were selected because they were favorites of Wilson's mother. The popularity of the sign led to many imitations, some of which remain to this day.","In 1982, following Wilson's departure, the Holiday Inn board of directors phased out the \"Great Sign\" in favor of a cheaper back-lit sign. The decision essentially signaled the end of the Wilson era, and Wilson considered it \"the worst mistake they ever made\". He loved the \"Great Sign\" so much that it was engraved on his tombstone, with the marquee reading \"FOUNDER\" and the arrow aimed at his name.[10]\n\nThe majority of the signs were sold as scrap metal and recycled.","Several intact fragments of the famous sign have been restored and relit, mostly the Holiday Inn top section of the sign and the marquee box. In 2006, a complete sign was found. The disassembled sign, complete with star, marquee box, and the sign base, was discovered in a backlot in Minnesota. On June 3, 2007, it was purchased by a neon sign restoration expert, in order to restore it to its 1950s appearance. It would be displayed at the National Save the Neon Signs Museum in Minot, North Dakota. An intact sign that came from a Las Vegas location stands outside of the American Sign Museum\nin Cincinnati, Ohio. Another intact and operating Holiday Inn Great Sign is at The Henry Ford\nMuseum in Dearborn, Michigan, and yet another is with a private collector in Park Hills, Kentucky.","Although still a healthy company, changing business conditions and demographics saw Holiday Inn lose its market dominance in the 1980s. Holiday Inns, Inc. was renamed \"Holiday Corporation\" in 1985 to reflect the growth of the company's brands, including nt\"\u003eHarrah's Entertainment\n, Embassy Suites Hotels\n, Crowne Plaza\n, Homewood Suites\n, and Hampton Inn\n. In 1988, Holiday Corporation was purchased by UK-based Bass PLC\n(the owners of the Bass\nbeer brand), followed by the remaining domestic Holiday Inn hotels in 1990, when founder Wilson sold his interest, after which the hotel group was known as Holiday Inn Worldwide\n. The remainder of Holiday Corporation (including the Embassy Suites Hotels\n, Homewood Suites\n, and Hampton Inn\nbrands) was spun off to shareholders as Promus Companies Incorporated\n. In 1990, Bass launched Holiday Inn Express, a complementary brand in the limited service segment.[11]\n\n[12]\n\n[13]\n\n","In 1997, Bass created and launched a new hotel brand, Staybridge Suites by Holiday Inn, entering the North American upscale extended stay market. In March 1998, Bass acquired the InterContinental\nbrand, expanding into the luxury hotel market. In 2000 Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) and changed its name to Six Continents PLC\n. InterContinental Hotels Group\n(IHG) was created in 2003 after Six Continents split into two daughter companies: Mitchells \u0026amp; Butlers\nPLC to handle restaurant assets, and IHG to focus on soft drinks and hotels, including the Holiday Inn brand.[14]\n\n","The brand name Holiday Inn\nis now owned by IHG, which in turn licenses the name to franchisees and third parties who operate hotels under management agreements.[15]\n\n","In 1999, the hotel that changed into the Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando\nin 2005, opened, called \"Holiday Inn\".","The Wall Street Journal\n\nreported in 2002 that the company, led by Ravi Saligram, was producing a new 130-room \"Next Generation\" prototype hotel to rebuild the brand. It would include a bistro-like restaurant and an indoor pool. The first of these prototype hotels, the Holiday Inn Gwinnett Center, was built in Duluth, Georgia\n, in 2003.","On October 24, 2007, IHG announced a worldwide relaunch of the Holiday Inn brand, which spelled trouble for the remaining motels. The relaunch was \"focused on delivering consistently best in class service and physical quality levels, including a redesigned welcome experience [and] signature bedding and bathroom products\". The first relaunched Holiday Inn opened in the U.S. in spring 2008. Currently there are more than 2,500 relaunched Holiday Inn brand hotels around the world, and the Holiday Inn global brand relaunch process was completed by the end of 2010.[16]\n\nBy then, the majority of the HI motels were removed from the chain, with a few exceptions. (In the 1980s and 1990s, HI hotels were built alongside the motel properties [i.e. Baton Rouge, Louisiana] in order to provide more amenities and newer rooms.) When the relaunch occurred, these motels were either demolished or closed off, even if a full-service hotel was already on site. Today, fewer than 10 Holiday Inn motels still operate, others having been replaced by newer Holiday Inn Express locations or having switched to other chains.","In September 2008, IHG announced the creation of a new timeshare brand, Holiday Inn Club Vacations, a strategic alliance with The Family of Orange Lake Resorts.[17]\n\n","1985–1990","1983–2007","2007–present","Although originally called \"Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza\", the Crowne Plaza moniker was split from Holiday Inn in 1994 to form a distinctive brand.","During the 1960s and 1970s, there were several Holiday Inn Jr. motels with just 44 to 48 guest rooms located in portables. Locations included Camden, Arkansas\n; Rantoul, Illinois\n; Cleveland, Mississippi\n; Sardis, Mississippi\n; Farmington, Missouri\n; Springfield, Tennessee\n; and Columbus, Texas\n. A traditionally constructed lobby building featured a Holiday Grill restaurant. The Camden location had just 32 rooms while the Rantoul location had 64 rooms.","Holiday Inn Magazine\nwas a monthly publication for guests during the 1970s. It featured travel destination and attraction stories in addition to a featured hotel property.","Elton John\nand Bernie Taupin\ncomposed the song \"Holiday Inn\" which was released on the Madman Across the Water\nalbum in 1971. Elton explains to audiences that during their first years of touring across America, they would stay in the same identical rooms no matter where they were. As Bernie summed up in the lyrics, \"From a terminal gate to a black limousine, it's a ten-minute ride to the Holiday Inn\".

As of September 2016, there were 2,469 Holiday Inn Express hotels featuring over 240,000 rooms worldwide.[1]\n\n","The Holiday Inn Express concept was intended to target the \"upper economy\" market segment, offering limited service, low-price lodging.[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n","In Europe, the hotels were known as Express by Holiday Inn\n,[6]\n\nbut this variation was phased out during the Holiday Inn Global Brand Relaunch which was announced in 2007.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","","","In 1991, the first Holiday Inn Express locations opened, with three hotels opening in the United States\n. Plans at the time called for 250 locations to be open by 1995.[1]\n\n","In 1996, the brand's first European location opened in Scotland.[1]\n\n","Starting in 1998, Holiday Inn Express started an ad campaign called \"Stay Smart\" ads that featured ordinary people achieving superior feats, such as averting a nuclear disaster or performing like rock stars. When questioned on whether or not they are professionals, they would attribute their skills to their stay there with the reply: \"No, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night!\" These ads have received positive reviews, and have been so successful they have crossed over into popular culture, having been featured in late night comedian jokes and political cartoons.[7]\n\nCurrent ads feature comedian Rob Riggle\n.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Typical Holiday Inn Express hotels are built from corporate architectural\nprototypes, and tend to consist of 60-80 rooms, with a mix of suites\nand standard rooms in North America properties. Because the chain has been undergoing tremendous growth, the majority of Holiday Inn Express hotels are brand new or newly renovated\n.[8]\n\n[9]\n\n[10]\n\n"],"title":"Holiday Inn

The company is headquartered at the Atlanta\nStore Support Center in unincorporated Cobb County, Georgia\n(with an Atlanta mailing address).","It operates many big-box format stores\nacross the United States (including all 50 states, the District of Columbia\n, Puerto Rico\n, the Virgin Islands\n, and Guam\n), all 10 provinces of Canada\n, and the country of Mexico\n. The MRO\ncompany Interline Brands\nis also owned by The Home Depot with 70 distribution centers across the United States.[4]\n\n[5]\n\n","The Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer in the United States, ahead of rival \u003eLowe's\n.[6]\n\n","","","The Home Depot was co-founded by Bernard Marcus\n, Arthur Blank\n, Ron Brill\n, and Pat Farrah\nin 1978.[7]\n\nThe Home Depot's proposition was to build home-improvement superstores\n, larger than any of their competitors' facilities. Investment banker Ken Langone\nhelped Marcus and Blank to secure the necessary capital\n.","In 1979, the first two stores, built in spaces leased from J. C. Penney\nthat were originally Treasure Island\n\"hypermarket\n\" (discount department\nand grocery\n) stores, opened in metro Atlanta\n(in Doraville\nand on Memorial Drive\nin Decatur\n, both near I-285\n)[9]\n\non June 21. On September 22, 1981 The Home Depot went public on the NASDAQ\nand raised $4.093 million. The Home Depot joined the New York Stock Exchange\non April 19, 1984.[10]\n\n","The Home Depot began to branch out of Georgia to Florida in 1981 with stores opening in Hollywood\nand Ft. Lauderdale\n. By 1984 The Home Depot was operating 19 stores with sales of over $256 million. To enter the Dallas\nmarket The Home Depot acquired Bowater Home Center from Bowater Inc. on October 31, 1984 for $40 million.[11]\n\nThe increased expansion of The Home Depot in the mid-1980s created financial difficulties with earnings falling at 42% and debt rising to $200 million. The financial difficulties of The Home Depot also caused the stock price to fall. To curb The Home Depot difficulties it opened only 10 stores in 1986 with a stock offering 2.99 million shares at $17 per share that helped The Home Depot to restructure its debts.[12]\n\n","In 1989 The Home Depot became the largest home improvement store in the United States surpassing Lowe's. In the 1990s The Home Depot searched for ways to redefine its marketplace. An installation program for quality home improvement items such as windows or carpets was launched in 1991 called the EXPO with success. A 480-page book Home Improvement 1-2-3\nwas published in 1995. The Canadian hardware chain itle=\"Aikenhead's Hardware\"\u003eAikenhead's Hardware\nwas acquired by The Home Depot in 1994 for $150 million with a 75% share. All of the Aikenhead's Hardware stores were later converted to The Home Depot stores.[13]\n\nBy 1995 sales reached $10 billion in sales while operating 350 stores.","Former General Electric\nexecutive Robert Nardelli\nbecame CEO and President of The Home Depot in 2000.[14]\n\n","San Diego\nmaintenance and repair supplies company Maintenance Warehouse was purchased by The Home Depot in 1997 for $245 million.[15]\n\nMaintenance Warehouse was purchased because it was a leading direct-mail marketer of maintenance, repair and operations supplies that can reach customers out of reach by The Home Depot.[16]\n\n[17]\n\nAtlanta-based company Apex Supply was acquired by The Home Depot in 1999. Apex Supply is a wholesale distributor of plumbing, HVAC, industrial pipe and fittings.[18]\n\nApex Supply and Maintenance Warehouse were rebranded in 2004 as The Home Depot Supply\n.[19]\n\n","In 2004, Home Depot employees at a suburban Detroit store in Harper Woods, Michigan\n, rejected a bid to be represented by a labor union\n, voting 115 to 42 against joining the United Food and Commercial Workers. If the union had won, the Michigan store would have been the first Home Depot to have union representation.[20]\n\n","Your Other Warehouse\n, a large plumbing distributor with a focus on special order fulfillment, was acquired by The Home Depot in 2001. Your Other Warehouse also supplied two divisions of The Home Depot and the EXPO Design Centers.[21]\n\nThe EXPO Design Center\ndivision was reorganized in 2001 with three divisions based in the Northeast at South Plainfield, New Jersey\n, the West at Orange, California\n, and the Southeast at Atlanta, Georgia\n.[22]\n\n","The Home Depot entered the Mexican\nmarket in 2002 with the acquisition of the home improvement chain Del Norte. In addition, The Home Depot had begun construction of stores in Mexicali\nand Tijuana\n.[23]\n\nIn the same year the Home Depot Landscape Supply\nwas launched to integrate professional landscapers and upscale plants into a plant nursery\nretail chain.[24]\n\nHome Depot Landscape Supply lasted only five years with only a few stores each in metro Atlanta and Dallas/Fort Worth\n. The Home Depot decided to close all Home Depot Landscape Supply stores in late 2007.[25]\n\n","In September 2005, Home Depot Direct launched its online home-furnishings store, 10 Crescent Lane\n, shortly followed by the launch of Paces Trading Company\n, its online lighting store. In mid 2006, the Home Depot acquired Home Decorators Collection\n, which was placed as an additional brand under its Home Depot Direct division.","In 2006, the Home Depot acquired Hughes Supply\nthe largest home retailer in the United States for $3.2 billion.[26]\n\nHughes Supply was integrated into The Home Depot Supply to better serve business-to-business customers.[27]\n\nThe Home Depot Supply rebranded under the new name HD Supply\nin January 2007.[28]\n\nFive months later The Home Depot sold HD Supply to a consortium of three private equity\nfirms, The Carlyle Group\n, Bain Capital\nand Clayton, Dubilier and Rice\n(with each agreeing to buy a one-third stake in the division).[29]\n\n","On January 2, 2007, the Home Depot and Robert Nardelli\nmutually agreed on Nardelli's resignation as CEO after a six-year tenure. Nardelli resigned amid complaints over his heavy-handed management and whether his pay package of $123.7 million (excluding stock option\ngrants) over the previous five years was excessive, considering the stock's poor performance versus its competitor ref=\"/wiki/Severance_package\" title=\"Severance package\"\u003eseverance package\nof $210 million was criticized because when the stock went down, his pay went up.[30]\n\n[31]\n\n","His successor, Frank Blake\n, previously served as the company's vice chairman of the board and executive vice president. Blake agreed to a much more conservative compensation package than Nardelli, that is very heavily dependent upon the success of the company. Although a longtime deputy to Nardelli at GE and Home Depot, Blake was said to lack Nardelli's hard edge and instead preferred to make decisions by consensus. Indeed, Blake repudiated many of his predecessor's strategies, and it has been reported that the two men have not spoken since Nardelli departed Home Depot.[30]\n\n[32]\n\n","In 2008 and 2009, with the downturn in the housing market, The Home Depot announced the layoff of several thousand associates, as well as the closing of 54 stores nationwide, including the entire EXPO Design Center chain.[33]\n\nAssociates at EXPO were allowed to re-apply for Home Depot jobs after the layoffs\n, and did not lose any tenure if hired back. In the year of February 2009, sales totaled $71.288 billion, more than $20 billion down from the peak of two years earlier due to the sale of HD Supply and falling revenue at the retained business. In 2012, they proceeded to close the big-box style stores that they had in China, however smaller stores that specialized in custom products and focused on more intimate interactions between customers and associates remain open there.[34]\n\n[35]\n\n","In 2013 The Home Depot established two large distribution centers in Atlanta\nand Los Angeles\n.[36]\n\n","In August 2014 it was announced that Frank Blake would step down as CEO and would be replaced by 57-year-old Craig Menear. The change occurred on November 1, 2014. Blake would continue with the company as chairman. Menear joined The Home Depot in 1997, and served in various management and vice-presidential positions, until 2003, including merchandising vice president of hardware, merchandising vice president of the Southwest Division, and divisional merchandise manager of the Southwest Division. He subsequently served as senior vice president of merchandising from August 2003 to April 2007. He then served as an executive vice president of merchandising from April 2007 to February 2014. Until becoming CEO, Menear served as president of U.S. Retail from February 2014 to November 1, 2014.[37]\n\n","The company had a data breach in September 2014.[38]\n\nOne major reason for the data breach was the practice of entering credit card numbers directly into computers at the service-desk and pro-desk, and in specialty departments including flooring, kitchen cabinets, appliances, and millwork, rather than using POS credit card terminals directly. The practice was stopped, and Home Depot offered a year of free credit monitoring through AllClearID for any customers who requested it. There were also reports of credit card numbers being stolen when used to make purchases on Homedepot.com.","On July 22, 2015, Home Depot acquired Interline Brands\nfrom P2 Capital Partners, Goldman Sachs'\nprivate equity arm, and the management of Interline Brands for $1.6 billion.[39]\n\nInterline Brands became fully integrated with The Home Depot in August 2016 with the Interline Brands website merging with The Home Depot website. The subsidiaries of Interline Brands are now companies of The Home Depot.[40]\n\n","The Home Depot's mascot has been Homer D. Poe since 1981, when it was first used in advertising. Gwyn Raker, the illustrator says, \"I designed him to be a funny guy next door who wasn't intimidating.\" The Homer Fund, a for-associate charity, is named after the mascot, who since its creation, has been a part of Home Depot culture ever since. This includes signage, advertising, awards and even a life-size costume for stores to rent out. Homer has a wife, named Daisy. [41]\n\n","Home Depot stores average 105,000\u0026#160;ft2\n(9,755 m2\n) in size and are organized warehouse-style, stocking a large range of supplies.

It was announced in August 2014 that Craig Menear will take over for Frank Blake as CEO while Blake will remain the chairman of the board.[43]\n\n","The slogan \"More saving. More doing.\" was introduced by The Home Depot in the March 18, 2009 circular, replacing \"You can do it. We can help.\" which had been used since 2003.[44]\n\nOther slogans used in the past 25 years include \"The Home Depot, Low prices are just the beginning\" in the early 1990s and \"When you're at the Home Depot, You'll feel right at home\" in the late 1990s and \"The Home Depot: First In Home Improvement!\" from 1999 to 2003.[45]\n\n","Long-time employee Marc Powers became the head of Home Depot's US stores division in 2014. He took the place of Marvin Ellison\n, who left to become the chief executive of J.C. Penney\n. In January, 2016 Home Depot announced the departure of Powers as division head, to be replaced by another veteran employee, Ann-Marie Campbell, one of Powers' deputies. The change in leadership is effective as of February 1, 2016. Ms. Campbell has been employed by Home Depot for over 30 years, beginning as a cashier in a branch in South Florida\n.

The first such \"Home Depot Fuel\" convenience store (C-Store) was located in Brentwood, Tennessee\nfollowed a month later by a center about 20 miles (32\u0026#160;km) away in Hermitage, both suburbs of Nashville. Four additional prototype stores were built within the year at Acworth, Georgia\n; Smyrna, Tennessee\n; Greensboro, Georgia\n; and then Winchester, Tennessee\nin that order. The centers were expected to earn $5–$7 million per year, though the actual number was reported to be much higher. The fuel centers sell beer, hot food, and snacks along with providing diesel fuel and gas at a separate island. This allows contractors with large trucks to be able to fill their vehicles. The fuel centers offer car washes, which are large enough to accommodate full-size pickup trucks and other large commercial vehicles.[50]\n\n","Current members of the board of directors of the Home Depot are: F. Duane Ackerman, David H. Batchelder, Frank Blake, Ari Bousbib, Gregory D. Brenneman, Albert P. Carey, Armando Codina, Bonnie G.

The label promotes energy conservation, sustainable forestry and clean water. Home Depot executives said that as the world's-largest buyer of construction material, their company had the power to persuade thousands of suppliers, homebuilders and consumers to follow its lead on environment sustainability. \"Who in the world has a chance to have a bigger impact on this sector than Home Depot?\" asked Ron Jarvis, vice president for environmental innovation at Home Depot.[59]\n\nThis program is following The Home Depot's promise in the late 1990s to eliminate the number of sales of lumber from endangered forests in countries including Chile and Indonesia.[60]\n\nHome Depot has since worked with environmental groups to create a variety of green programs. For example, Home Depot planted thousands of trees at its headquarters in Atlanta to offset carbon emissions.

Stewart drove The Home Depot-sponsored #20 car for Joe Gibbs Racing until 2008, winning 2 of his 3 series championships in the car, and was succeeded by Joey Logano\n, who took the car to victory lane twice. After Matt Kenseth\njoined the team, The Home Depot's status as the #20's primary sponsor was taken over by Dollar General\n, but the company still served as its most frequent secondary sponsor through its Husky Tools division. On June 23, 2014, the company announced it would end its NASCAR sponsorship after 2014.[64]\n\n","The Home Depot was the title sponsor of The Home Depot Center in Carson, California\n, home to both the Los Angeles Galaxy\nand Chivas USA\nof Major League Soccer\n, and Los Angeles Riptide\n(Major League Lacrosse\n), and many past major sporting events. The venue is now called StubHub Center\n.","In 2006, The Home Depot partnered with Duke University\n's Edmund T. Pratt Jr. School of Engineering\nto create \"The Home Depot Smart Home\". The smart home is a live-in laboratory for ten upper-class engineering students that allows them to immerse themselves in the work. The goal of the project is to help provide innovative solutions for the home in areas such as security and home monitoring, communications, energy efficiency, entertainment, environment and health.[65]\n\n","In January 2007, The Home Depot became the official home improvement sponsor of ESPN's College Gameday.[66]\n\n","Seventy-three percent of The Home Depot's campaign contributions went to Republican\ncandidates in the 2005–2006 US elections\n. \"Home Depot's PAC gives money based on a candidate's voting record, committee assignment and leadership position,\" said company spokesman Jerry Shields.[67]\n\nThe CEO in this period was Bob Nardelli\n, a friend of U.S. President George W. Bush\n.[68]\n\nNardelli hosted a garden reception/fundraiser for Bush at his Atlanta home on May 20, 2004.[69]\n\n","Home Depot Canada is the Canadian unit of the Home Depot and one of Canada's top home improvement retailers. The Canadian operation consists of 182 stores and employs over 28,000 people in Canada. Home Depot Canada has stores in all ten Canadian provinces and serves territorial Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon through electronic means (Online Sales). The Canadian head office is located in Toronto.","The Canadian unit was created with the purchase of ead's Hardware\n. Home Depot management has an ambitious plan to overtake its biggest competitor, RONA\n, which has about four times as many stores. However, some of RONA's stores are smaller than the typical Home Depot store. In terms of big box stores, the Home Depot has more stores than RONA, (not including other Rona banners such as Réno Dépôt or Cashway). As of 2007, RONA pulled ahead of The Home Depot in total retail sales, due to aggressive consolidation efforts by RONA, combined with the loss of The Home Depot's industrial supply division, HD Supply, in July 2007. The Home Depot now faces competition from Lowe's as they have moved into the Canadian market effective the end of 2007; Lowe's now has 35 outlets in Canada.","In Quebec\n, where it has 22 stores, The Home Depot is branded simply \"Home Depot\" (using English words but without the definite article\n\"the\").","The Home Depot operates 106 stores in Mexico[70]\n\nand has become one of the largest retailers in Mexico since it entered the market in 2001. The Home Depot increased its presence in Mexico in 2004, with the acquisition of Home Mart, the second largest Mexican home improvement retailer.","The Home Depot Mexico employs more than 11,000 associates throughout the country and has an annual growth rate of 10 percent.[71]\n\n","In December 2006, the Home Depot announced its acquisition of the Chinese home improvement retailer The Home Way.[72]\n\nThe acquisition gave the Home Depot an immediate presence in China, with 12 stores in six cities.","In April, 2011, Home Depot shut its last Beijing store, the fifth Home Depot to close in China in the previous two years. In September 2012, The Home Depot announced it was closing all big box stores in China. The Home Depot retained two specialty stores in China, a Home Decorators Collection Store and a paint and flooring store.[73]\n\n","As of September 16, 2012, all seven of the box stores in China had been shut down.[74]\n\nThe Home Depot has no immediate plans to further expand its specialty stores in China. The company is taking a \"wait-and-see\" attitude towards the Chinese market, but does not want to completely pull out because re-entry into the market would be very costly.","The Home Depot's lack of success in China has been attributed to the disconnect between The Home Depot's do-it-yourself ethos and Chinese culture. In 2012, the Home Depot conceded that it misread the country's appetite for do-it-yourself products. As a spokeswoman for the company said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, \"The market trend says this is more of a do-it-for-me culture\".[73]\n\nCulturally, manual labor is seen as an activity for lower-class citizens, and some have speculated that The Home Depot could have capitalized on this by offering a do-it-for-me model to Chinese consumers. Chinese consumers prefer to see a finished product, such as a renovated room, rather than light bulbs and lumber.[75]\n\nThe same issue does not exist outside of China, especially in Canada, where Chinese Home Depot advertisements and store signage can be found in areas with large Chinese demographics.","There were reports that the Home Depot was interested in acquiring B\u0026amp;Q\n, the largest DIY\nretailer in the United Kingdom\n, Ireland\nand China\n. Speculation of a takeover began in 1999 when the retailer Asda\nwas purchased by Walmart\n. The Home Depot would have to acquire Kingfisher plc\n, B\u0026amp;Q's parent company, to acquire B\u0026amp;Q. Kingfisher consists of several European DIY chains; however, the Home Depot was only interested in B\u0026amp;Q operations and says that it would dispose of the Castorama\nchain which operates in France, Italy, Poland and Russia. Talks ending in 2005 did not result in any takeover deal.[76]\n\n[77]\n\n[78]\n\n[79]\n\n","In 1997, Home Depot entered the Chilean and Argentine markets. While the venture was viewed with great optimism by founders Bernard Marcus\nand Arthur Blank\n,[80]\n\nit eventually proved unprofitable. In October 2001, Chilean partners Falabella\nbought out Home Depot's share of the five Chilean Home Center stores and rebranded them Home Store. In 2003, after merging with Sodimac\n, all stores adopted that brand. The company has since expanded across Latin America very profitably and successfully. It's currently the N°1 Home Improvement company in South America. In 2002, Argentina's Home Depots were bought out by Chilean company Cencosud\nand rebranded Easy\nstores, a company that has also expanded across South America. It's currently the N°2 Home Improvement company in South America.","The Home Depot was embroiled in whistleblower\nlitigation brought under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n(SOX) law. In July 2005, former employee Michael Davis, represented by attorney Mark D. Schwartz\nfiled a whistleblower lawsuit against the Home Depot, alleging that his discharge was in retaliation for refusing to make unwarranted backcharges against vendors. Davis alleges that the Home Depot forced its employees to meet a set quota of backcharges to cover damaged or defective merchandise, forcing employees to make chargebacks to vendors for merchandise that was undamaged and not defective. The Home Depot alleges that it fired Davis for repeatedly failing to show up for work.","The trial initially was concluded in June 2006, but in April 2007, U.S. Department of Labor Judge Pamela Lakes Wood ordered the case reopened after the Home Depot's law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer \u0026amp; Feld\nrevealed that the retail giant's in-house counsel had told them that two Home Depot employees who testified at the trial had lied. Akin Gump sent Wood a letter on September 29, 2006, in which the law firm requested that the testimony be stricken. In response to Akin Gump's revelation, Davis' attorney Mark D. Schwartz asked for the case to be reopened to permit further questioning of the witnesses. On April 6, 2007, Wood ordered the case to be reopened.","Schwartz was quoted by the New York Post\n\nas saying, \"I have reason to believe these witnesses were intimidated into giving false testimony.\" The Home Depot called Schwartz's allegations \"meritless\".[81]\n\n","Home Depot has settled the dispute in a stipulation of settlement dated March 28, 2008. In the settlement, Home Depot changed some of its corporate governance provisions. Home Depot also agreed to pay the plaintiff's counsel $6 million in cash and $8.5 million in common stock.[82]\n\n","Powell v. Home Depot\nUSA, Inc. (2008cv61862) (2011) was a decision by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida\nconcerning patent infringement\non a \"safe hands\" device that Michael Powell, an independent contractor for Home Depot, created in response to injuries to the hands of associates using in-store radial arm saws. The District court jury returned a verdict in favor of Powell.","In 2011, Home Depot appealed against the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\n, challenging the district court's denial of its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issues of infringement, willfulness, and damages.[83]\n\n[84]\n\nThey also challenged the district court's claim construction, inequitable conduct, and attorney fees determinations. The appellate court found no inequitable conduct and insufficiently egregious misconduct on the part of Powell's attorney.[85]\n\n","In the wake of the 2011 Joplin tornado\nin which the walls of a Home Depot collapsed after being hit by an EF5 tornado\n, The Kansas City Star\n\n, citing engineers, criticized Home Depot's practice of using tilt-up\nconstruction in hundreds of its big-box stores (other nearby big-box stores in Joplin, including a Walmart\nand Academy Sports\n, which had concrete block\nconstruction, lost their roofs but the walls remained intact). In tilt-up construction the concrete is poured onsite, lifted into place, and then attached to the roof. The engineers told the Star\nthat the practice, while normally safe and efficient, is dangerous in major storms because once the roof is lifted (as happened in Joplin) the walls collapse in a domino effect\n. Seven people were killed in the front of the store when the 100,000-pound walls collapsed on them, while 28 people in the back of the store survived when those walls collapsed outward. Only two of the slab walls in the Home Depot survived. In contrast, 3 people died in the Walmart but 200 survived. Engineers noted that when concrete block construction fails, structural elements break in pieces and usually not in huge slabs. Home Depot said it fundamentally disagreed with the engineers quoted by the Star\nand said it would use tilt-up construction when it rebuilds the Joplin store.[86]\n\n","On September 2, 2014, security news reporter Brian Krebs\nreported that he was seeing evidence of credit card numbers linked to Home Depot purchases being sold online, which he concluded to suggest that The Home Depot's payment systems were breached by hackers.[87]\n\nOn September 8, 2014, Home Depot confirmed\nthat their payment systems were compromised. According to their press release, this breach affected any customers who made purchases at any Home Depot store from April 2014 to September 2014. Home Depot offered their affected customers free one-year credit monitoring service from AllClear ID\n. Also in their press release, they made sure to emphasize that there was no evidence to suggest that online customers were affected by the breach. On September 18, 2014, Home Depot released a statement saying that the hackers obtained a total of 56 million credit card numbers\nas a result of the breach. Since the breach, Home Depot has rolled out new encryption technology for their cash registers and self-checkout systems to protect customers. A class action lawsuit was filed against the company.","In March 2016 Home Depot agreed to pay at least $19.5 million to compensate the more than 50 million consumers affected. The settlement terms included a $13 million fund to reimburse shoppers and a $6.5 million fund for cardholder identity protection services.[88]\n\n","In September 2012, Home Depot agreed to pay $100,000 and furnish other relief to settle a disability\ndiscrimination lawsuit[89]\n\nfiled by the U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n, for the alleged failure to provide a reasonable accommodation\nfor a cashier with cancer at its Towson, Maryland\n, store and then for purportedly firing her because of her condition.[90]\n\n","\n"],"title":"The Home

As of the 2015, the population was 741,334,[1]\n\nmaking it Georgia's third-most populous county. Its county seat\nand largest city is Marietta\n.[2]\n\n","Cobb, along with several adjoining counties, was created on December 3, 1832, by the Georgia General Assembly\nfrom the large Cherokee County\nterritory—land northwest of the Chattahoochee River\nwhich the state confiscated\nfrom the Cherokee Nation\nand redistributed to settlers\nvia lottery\n, following the passage of the federal Indian Removal Act\n.[3]\n\nThe county was named for Thomas Willis Cobb\n, a United States representative\nand senator\nfrom Georgia. It is believed Marietta was named for his wife\n, Mary.[4]\n\n","Cobb County is included in the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, GA Metropolitan Statistical Area\n. It is situated immediately to the northwest of Atlanta's city limits.","Its Cumberland District\n, an edge city\n, has over 24,000,000 square feet (2,200,000\u0026#160;m2\n) of office space. As of 2017, Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves\nplay in Cumberland.[5]\n\n","The U.S. Census Bureau ranks Cobb County as the most-educated in the state of Georgia and 12th among all counties in the United States.[6]\n\nIt has ranked among the top 100 wealthiest counties in the United States\n.[7]\n\nIn October 2017 Cobb was ranked as the \"Least Obese County in Georgia\"[8]\n\n","","","Cobb county was one of nine Georgia counties carved out of the disputed territory of the Cherokee Nation in 1832.[9]\n\nIt was the 81st county in Georgia and named for Judge Thomas Willis Cobb\n, who served as a U.S. senator, state representative, and superior court judge. It is believed that the county seat of Marietta was named for Judge Cobb's wife, Mary.[10]\n\nThe state started acquiring right-of-way\nfor the Western \u0026amp; Atlantic Railroad\nin 1836. A train began running between Marietta and Marthasville\n(now Atlanta) in 1845.[11]\n\nBefore the Civil War, Marietta was a summer resort\nfor residents of Savannah\nand Charleston\nfleeing yellow fever\n.","During the American Civil War, some confederate troops were trained at a camp in Big Shanty (now Kennesaw), where the Andrews Raid\noccurred, starting the Great Locomotive Chase\n.[11]\n\nThere were battles of New Hope Church\nMay 25, f Pickett's Mill\"\u003ePickett's Mill\nMay 27, and Dallas\nMay 28. These were followed by the prolonged series of battles through most of June until very early July: the Battle of Marietta\nand the Battle of Noonday Creek\n. The Battle of Allatoona Pass\non October 28 occurred as Sherman was starting his Sea\" title=\"Sherman's March to the Sea\"\u003emarch through Georgia\n. Union forces burnt most houses and confiscated or burnt crops.[12]\n\nThe Battle of Kennesaw Mountain\nJune 27, 1864, was the site of the only major Confederate victory in General William T. Sherman\n's invasion of Georgia. Despite the victory, Union forces outflanked the Confederates.","In 1915, Leo Frank\n, the Jewish supervisor of an Atlanta pencil factory who was convicted of murdering one of his workers, thirteen-year-old Mary Phagan, was kidnapped from his jail cell and brought to Frey's Gin, two miles (3\u0026#160;km) east of Marietta, where he was lynched.","Cotton\nfarming\nin the area peaked from the 1890s through the 1920s. Low prices during the Great Depression\nresulted in the cessation of cotton farming throughout Cobb County.[13]\n\nThe price of cotton went from 16¢ per pound (35¢/kg) in 1920 to 9½¢ (21¢/kg) in 1930. This resulted in a cotton bust for the county, which had stopped growing the product but was milling it. This bust was in turn, followed by the Great Depression\n.[11]\n\n[14]\n\n[clarification needed\n\n\n]\nTo help combat the bust, the state started work on a road in 1922 that would later become U.S. 41\n, later replaced by Cobb Parkway\nin the late 1940s and early 1950s.","In 1942, Bell Aircraft opened a Marietta plant to manufacture B-29 bombers\nand Marietta Army Airfield\nwas founded. Both were closed after World War II, but reopened during the Korean War\n, when the air field was acquired by the Air Force, renamed Dobbins AFB, and the plant by Lockheed\n. During the Korean and Vietnam Wars\n, Lockheed Marietta was the leading manufacturer of military transport planes, including the C-130 Hercules\nand the C-5 Galaxy\n. \"In Cobb County and other sprawling Cold War suburbs from Orange County\nto Norfolk\n/Hampton Roads\n, the direct link between federal defense spending and local economic prosperity structured a bipartisan political culture of hawkish conservatism and material self-interest on issues of national security.\"[15]\n\n","When county home rule\nwas enacted statewide by amendment\nto the Georgia state constitution\nin the early 1960s, Ernest W. Barrett\nbecame the first chairman\nof the new county commission\n. The county courthouse\n, built in 1888, was demolished, spurring a law that now prevents counties from doing so without a referendum\n.","In the 1960s and 1970s, Cobb transformed from rural to suburban\n, as integration spurred white flight\nfrom the city of Atlanta, which by 1970 was majority-African-American. Real-estate booms drew rural white southerners and Rust Belt\ntransplants, both groups mostly first-generation white-collar workers\n. Cobb County was the home of former segregationist and Georgia governor Lester Maddox\n(1966–71). In 1975, Cobb voters elected John Birch Society\nleader Larry McDonald\nto Congress, running in opposition to desegregation busing\n. A conservative Democrat\n, McDonald called for investigations into alleged plots by the Rockefellers\nand the Soviet Union\nto impose \"socialist-one-world-government\" and co-founded the Western Goals Foundation\n. In 1983, McDonald died aboard Korean Air Lines Flight 007\n, shot down by a Soviet fighter jet over restricted airspace. I-75 through the county is now named for him.","In 1990, Republican Congressmen Newt Gingrich\nbecame Representative of a new district centered around Cobb County. In 1994, as Republicans took control of the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time in almost fifty years, Gingrich became Speaker of the House\n, thrusting Cobb County into the national spotlight. In 1993, county commissioners passed a resolution condemning homosexuality and cut off funding for the arts after complaints about a community theater.[16]\n\nAfter protests from gay rights organizations, organizers of the 1996 Summer Olympics\npulled events out of Cobb County, including the Olympic Torch Relay\n. The county's inns were nevertheless filled at 100% of capacity for two months during the event.[11]\n\n","In the 1990s and 2000s, Cobb's demographics changed. As Atlanta's gentrification\nreversed decades of white flight, middle-class African-Americans and Russian, Bosnian, Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Mexican and Central American immigrants moved to older suburbs in south and southwest Cobb. In 2010, African-American Democrat David Scott\nwas elected to ongressional district\n, which included many of those suburbs. Cobb became the first Georgia county to participate in the Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g)\nenabling local law officers to enforce immigration law.","According to the U.S. Census Bureau\n, the county has a total area of 345 square miles (890\u0026#160;km2\n), of which 340 square miles (880\u0026#160;km2\n) is land and 4.0 square miles (10\u0026#160;km2\n) (1.4%) is water.[17]\n\n","The county is divided between two major basins\n. Most runoff\nflows into the Middle Chattahoochee\n-Lake Harding\nand Upper Chattahoochee River\nsub-basins of the ACF River Basin\n(Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin) along the southeastern border, directly via Willeo Creek\n, Sope Creek\n(Sewell Creek), Rottenwood Creek\n(Powers Creek, Poorhouse Creek, Poplar Creek), Nickajack Creek\nand others.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nThe large Sweetwater Creek\nis the other major stream, carrying the waters of Noses Creek\n(Ward Creek, Olley Creek, Mud Creek), Powder Springs Creek\n(Rakestraw Creek, Mill Creek) and others into the Chattahoochee. A ridge\nfrom Lost Mountain\nin the west, to Kennesaw Mountain\nin the north-central, to Sweat Mountain\nin the extreme northeast, divides the far north-northwest of the county into the Etowah River\nsub-basin of the ACT River Basin\n(Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin), which includes Lake Allatoona\n. Noonday Creek\n(Little Noonday Creek) flows northward into the lake, as does Allatoona Creek\n, which forms a major arm of the lake. Proctor Creek forms the much older Lake Acworth\n, which in turn empties directly into Lake Allatoona under the Lake Acworth Drive (Georgia 92\n) bridge.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nNorth Cobb is in the Coosa River\nbasin.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","There are several high points in Cobb County.","Despite the lack of a grid system of city blocks\nthough the county, all street addresses\nhave their numeric origin\nat the southwest corner of the town square\nin Marietta.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Originally in area code 404\n, the county was moved into area code 770\nin 1995, and overlaid by area code 678\nin 1998. Prior to 1995, those with phones tied to the Woodstock telephone exchange\n(prefixes 924, 926, 928, later 516 and 591) could also call the Canton\nexchange (479, later 445, then 704) as a local call. This became moot, along with other dual-zone exchanges in metro Atlanta, when the exurban\nexchanges (including Canton) were fully made a part of what was already the world's largest toll-free calling zone. It is a zone spanning 7,162 square miles (18,549\u0026#160;km2\n),[18]\n\nwith four active telephone\narea codes\n, and local calling extending into portions of two others.","Cobb's FIPS county code\nis 13067. Because the National Weather Service\nhas not subdivided the county, its WRSAME\ncode is 013067, for receiving targeted weather warnings\nfrom NOAA Weather Radio\n. The county is primarily within the broadcast range\nof one weather radio station\n: KEC80, on 162.550\u0026#160;MHz,[19]\n\ntransmitted to all of metro Atlanta and broadcast from NWSFO Peachtree City\n.

The Hooters name is a double entendre\nreferring to both its owl\nlogo, a bird known for its \"hooting\" calls, and an American slang term for women's breasts popularized by comedian Steve Martin\non the hit comedy series Saturday Night Live\n\n.[2]\n\nHooters also had an airline\n, Hooters Air\n, with a normal flight crew and flight attendants, and scantily clad Hooters Girls on every flight.[3]\n\n","The waiting staff\nat Hooters restaurants are primarily attractive young women, usually referred to simply as \"Hooter Girls\", whose revealing outfits and sex appeal\nare played up and are a primary component of the company's image. This characteristic has led to Hooters being described as the first and leading breastaurant\n. The company employs men and women as cooks, hosts (at some franchises), busboys\n, and managers.[4]\n\nThe menu includes hamburgers\nand other sandwiches\n, steaks, seafood entrees, appetizers, and the restaurant's specialty, chicken wings\n. Almost all Hooters restaurants hold alcoholic beverage licenses to sell beer and wine, and where local permits allow, a full liquor bar.

Stewart\n, Gil DiGiannantonio, Ed Droste\n, Billy Ranieri, Ken Wimmer and Dennis Johnson. The date was an April Fools' Day joke because the original six owners believed that their prospect was going to fail. Their first Hooters restaurant was built on the site of a former rundown nightclub that had been purchased at a low price. So many businesses had folded in that particular location that the Hooters founders built a small \"graveyard\" at the front door for each that had come and gone before them. The first restaurant opened its doors on October 4, 1983, in Clearwater.[8]\n\nThis original location was decorated with memorabilia from Waverly, Iowa, hometown to some of the original Hooters 6.","In 1984 Hugh Connerty bought the rights to Hooters from the Original Hooters 6. Robert H. Brooks\nand a group of Atlantan\ninvestors (operators of Hooters of America, Inc.) bought out Hugh Connerty. In 2002, Brooks bought majority control and became chairman.[9]\n\nThe Clearwater-based company retained control over restaurants in the Tampa Bay Area\n, Chicago metropolitan area\n, and one in Manhattan\n, New York,[10]\n\nwhile all other locations were under the aegis of Hooters of America, which sold franchising rights to the rest of the United States and international locations.[11]\n\nUnder Brooks's leadership, the collective Hooters brand expanded to more than 425 stores worldwide. Brooks died on July 15, 2006, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, of a heart attack\n.[12]\n\nBrooks's will\ngave most of Hooters of America Inc. to his son Coby Brooks\nand daughter Boni Belle Brooks.[13]\n\n[dead link\n\n\n]\n\n","The Hooters Casino Hotel\nwas opened February 2, 2006, off the Las Vegas Strip\nin Paradise, Nevada\n. This hotel has 696 rooms with a 35,000-square-foot (3,300\u0026#160;m2\n) casino. The hotel is owned and operated by 155 East Tropicana, LLC. It is adjacent to the Tropicana\n, across the street from the MGM Grand Las Vegas\n. As of 2014, it is the only Hooters facility offering lodging since a Hooters Inn motel located along Interstate 4\nin Lakeland, Florida\nwas demolished in 2007.","As part of their 25th anniversary, Hooters Magazine\nreleased its list of top Hooters Girls of all time. Among the best-known were Lynne Austin\n(the original Hooters Girl), the late Kelly Jo Dowd (the mother of the golfer Dakoda Dowd\n), Bonnie-Jill Laflin\n, Leeann Tweeden\n, and Holly Madison\n.[14]\n\n[15]\n\n","After Brooks' death, 240 buyers showed interest in Hooters of America Inc., and 17 submitted bids, with that number being reduced to eight, and then three, before the selection of Wellspring Capital Management\n.[13]\n\nChanticleer Holdings LLC, which had the right to block the sale after a $5\u0026#160;million loan made in 2006, did so in a December 1, 2010, letter to the court. As a result, Chanticleer and other investors bought the company.[5]\n\n[16]\n\n","As of July 2013[update]\n\nHooters of America owns 160 restaurants and operates or franchises over 430.[1]\n\n","The company's first overseas location was in Singapore\n, and there are Hooters restaurants in Aruba\n, Australia\n, Austria\n, Brazil\n, Bolivia\n, Canada\n, China\n, Colombia\n, Costa Rica\n, Nicaragua\n, Czech Republic\n, Dominican Republic\n, Ecuador\n, El Salvador\n, Germany\n, Guatemala\n, Hong Kong\n, Hungary\n, Indonesia\n, Japan\n, Mexico\n, Panama\n, Philippines\n, South Africa\n, South Korea\n, Switzerland\n, Taiwan\n, Thailand\n, Russia\n, and one in the United Kingdom\n, following the closure of the remaining UK franchises. The three largest Hooters restaurants are in Singapore\n, Tokyo\n, and São Paulo\n.","In 2013, the company announced a plan to remodel every restaurant in the chain. The prototype restaurant first remodeled was the location in Houston, Texas located off the Southwest Freeway at Kirby Drive near Downtown Houston. The new design (done by ASD|skydesign[17]\n\n) will feature more windows and outdoor dining and upgraded audio-visual systems to better appeal to sports enthusiasts. The first completely redesigned Hooters opened in New Orleans\nin July 2013. The company also announced changes to its menu, such as the addition of entrée salads.[18]\n\n","The appearance of the waitresses is a main selling feature of the restaurant. A Hooters Girl\nis a waitress employed by the Hooters restaurant chain. The girls are recognizable by their uniform of a white tank top\nwith the \"Hootie the Owl\" logo and the location name on the front paired with short nylon orange runner's shorts\n. The remainder of the Hooters Girls uniform consists of the restaurant's brown ticket pouch (or a black one with the black uniform), tan pantyhose\n, white loose socks\n, and clean white shoes. Men who work at Hooters wear Hooters hats, T-shirts with long pants, Bermuda shorts\n, or attire more suitable for kitchen use.[20]\n\n","In 1997, three men from the Chicago area sued Hooters after being denied employment at an Orland Park, Illinois\n, restaurant. Each of them was awarded $19,100. Four men who filed a similar lawsuit in Maryland\nreceived $10,350 each. The settlement allows Hooters to continue attracting customers with its female staff of Hooters Girls. The chain agreed to create other support jobs, like bartenders and hosts, that must be filled without regard to gender.[21]\n\n","In 2001, a jury determined Hooters of Augusta Inc. willfully violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nby sending unsolicited advertising faxes. The class-action lawsuit, brought in June 1995 by Sam Nicholson, included 1,320 others who said they received the advertising faxes from Hooters. Atlanta-based Hooters of America Inc., the local restaurant's parent company, paid out $11\u0026#160;million.[22]\n\nThe jury determined that six faxes were sent to each plaintiff. With a $500 fine for each, that amounts to a $3,000 award per plaintiff.[23]\n\n","Also in 2001, Jodee Berry, a waitress at a Hooters in Panama City Beach, Florida\nwon a beer sales contest, for which the promised prize was a new Toyota\nautomobile. However, the manager awarded her a \"toy Yoda\n\" instead, claiming the contest was an April Fool's Day joke. Berry filed a lawsuit against Gulf Coast Wings, the local franchisee, and later reached a settlement. [24]\n\n","In 2004, it was found that job applicants to a Hooters in West Covina, California\nwere secretly filmed while undressing, prompting a civil suit filed against the national restaurant chain in Los Angeles Superior Court.[25]\n\nThe company addressed the incident with additional employee training.","In 2009, Nikolai Grushevski, a man from Corpus Christi, Texas\n, filed a lawsuit because Hooters would not hire him as a waiter. Grushevski and Hooters reached a confidential settlement on April 13.[26]\n\nIn September 2009, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit against a North Carolina\ncharter airline (formerly Hooters Air\n, owned by Hooters of America) on behalf of Chau Nguyen, an Asian flight attendant fired three years prior after complaining only white workers were being promoted.[27]\n\n","In May 2010, a lawsuit was filed against Hooters in Michigan\nafter an employee was given a job performance review and was told that her shirt and short size could use some improvement by two women who held positions at the headquarters in Atlanta. Michigan is the only state that includes height and weight as bounds for non-discrimination in hiring. The plaintiff alleges that the women made the offer of a free gym membership and that if she did not improve in 30 days, her employment would be terminated.[28]\n\nThe company denied that they threatened to fire the plaintiffs, and the suit was settled out of court.[29]\n\n","In December 2010, as part of the settlement of Robert H. Brooks' estate\n, a judge in Horry County, South Carolina\napproved the sale of Hooters of America Inc. to Wellspring Capital Management\n. The decision did not prevent Charlotte, North Carolina\n–based Chanticleer Investors LLC from exercising \"the right of first refusal\" given to Chanticleer in a loan agreement with Hooters.[13]\n\n","In 2011, a number of former Hooters executives left to start a Twin Peaks\nfranchise group. Hooters filed suit and alleged that former Hooters executives stole trade secrets and management documents as part as their move to the new restaurant chain.[30]\n\nIn 2012, former employee Jheri Stratton filed suit after catching the airborne disease, tuberculosis\n, from one of her managers.[31]\n\n[32]\n\n","In 2012 Kisuk Cha, a Korean American immigrant who placed a takeout order at a Hooters in Queens, New York, sued the restaurant chain for racial discrimination after noticing a racial slur printed on a cash register receipt by a hostess who later confessed and subsequently resigned. As of April 2, 2015 (as a result of the Farryn Johnson racial discrimination lawsuit) the case has not been resolved.[33]\n\n","On April 2, 2015, former employee Farryn Johnson was awarded $250,000 after an arbitrator found that racial discrimination contributed to her termination. Johnson was terminated in August 2013 after her store manager (from the Hooters in Baltimore, Maryland) told her that she could not have blonde highlights in her hair. Johnson filed a civil rights complaint with the State of Maryland Civil Rights Division where her attorneys stated the applicability of the dress code for African Americans and everyone else (e.g. non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander American) where one set of policies pertains to a certain group of people was considered as racial discrimination. A statement from Hooters of America by Ericka Whitaker (Hooters of America senior brand manager) stated that she had no issue of having blonde highlights as a Hooters Girl prior to becoming a brand manager and the company will continue to diversify its employees, from the restaurant to the annual Hooters International Swimsuit Pageant.[34]\n\n[35]\n\n[36]\n\n","In employment discrimination law in the United States\n, employers are generally allowed to consider characteristics that would otherwise be discriminatory if they are bona fide\noccupational qualifications\n(BFOQ). For example, a manufacturer of men's clothing may lawfully advertise for male models. Hooters has argued a BFOQ defense, which applies when the \"essence of the business operation would be undermined if the business eliminated its discriminatory policy\".[26]\n\n","An older version of the Hooters Employee Handbook (prior to October 2006), published in The Smoking Gun\nreads:[20]\n\n","Customers can go to many places for wings and beer, but it is our Hooters Girls who make our concept unique. Hooters offers its customers the look of the \"All American Cheerleader, Surfer, Girl Next Door.\"","Female employees are required to sign that they \"acknowledge and affirm\" the following:","Hooters has actively supported charities through its Hooters Community Endowment Fund\n, also known as HOO.C.E.F.\n, a play on UNICEF\n. It has provided money and/or volunteers to charities such as Habitat for Humanity\n, The V Foundation for Cancer Research, Operation Homefront, Make-A-Wish Foundation\n, Special Olympics\n, Muscular Dystrophy Association\nand Stop Hunger Now\n.[37]\n\n[38]\n\nIn addition, after the 2007 death of Kelly Jo Dowd, a former Hooters Girl, Hooters calendar cover girl and later restaurant general manager\n, Hooters began a campaign in support of breast cancer\nresearch, with awareness of the issue being spread through the Kelly Jo Dowd Fund. By 2010 the chain raised over $2\u0026#160;million for the cause.[39]\n\n","In 2009, Hooters partnered with Operation Homefront to establish The Valentine Fund in honor of fallen soldier SOCS\nThomas J. Valentine. The fund supports the families of US Special Forces\nservice members and other military families. Thomas J. Valentine, a Navy SEAL\ntroop chief, was killed during a training exercise February 13, 2008. He left behind his wife, Christina, and two young children. Hooters established a fund in Valentine’s name through Operation Homefront.[40]\n\n[41]\n\n","Hooters is involved in the sports world. Previous sponsorships include the Miami Hooters\n, a now defunct Arena Football League\nteam. Hooters formerly sponsored the USAR Hooters Pro Cup\n, an automobile racing series, and the NGA Pro Golf Tour\n, a minor league golf tour.","In 1992, Hooters sponsored NASCAR\ndriver Alan Kulwicki\nas he won the Winston Cup\nChampionship, beating Bill Elliott\nby ten points, the closest margin in NASCAR prior to The Chase\nera. On April 1, 1993 Kulwicki, along with several others including Hooters Chairman Bob Brooks' son Mark were killed in a plane crash\nnear Bristol, Tennessee\n. They were flying back to the track\nfor Sunday's race after making a sponsor appearance at a Hooters in Knoxville, Tennessee\n. Hooters remained in the sport, sponsoring drivers like Loy Allen Jr.\n, Rick Mast\nand Brett Bodine\nbefore ending their involvement in 2003. The restaurant returned to NASCAR in 2007 to sponsor a Craftsman Truck Series\nteam led by Jason White\n, Derrike Cope\nand Brad Keselowski\n. Six years later, Hooters sponsored Nationwide Series\ndriver Nelson Piquet Jr.\n's car.[42]\n\nFor the angles' Southern 500\"\u003e2016 Bojangles' Southern 500\nat Darlington Raceway\n, Hooters made a comeback in the Cup Series with a one-off paint scheme for Greg Biffle\n.[43]\n\nHooters currently sponsors the No. 9 of Chase Elliott\n.[44]\n\n","Hooters has sponsored the Major League Eating\n-sanctioned \"Hooters Worldwide Wing Eating Championship\" since 2012.[45]\n\nHooters has also licensed its name for the Hooters Road Trip\n\nPlayStation\nracing game as well as a Hooters Calendar mobile wallpaper application. Oasys Mobile\nwill also be putting out several other games for mobile consumption based on the Hooters Calendar license in 2008.[46]\n\nIt was also one of several real world brands that appeared in the 2011 video game Homefront\n.","Since 1986, the restaurant has issued a calendar\nof their girls, with signings taking place in some of their restaurants.

ICE was also named to the Fortune 500 in June 2017 and is the only exchange operator included in the ranking.","The Intercontinental Exchange has had a policy to grow through the acquisition of other exchanges, a number of these have been successful while others have failed due to concerns by regulators or others that the new company would have created a monopoly situation. The major acquisition and attempted acquisitions have included:","In June 2001, ICE expanded its business into futures trading by acquiring the London-based International Petroleum Exchange\n(IPE), now ICE Futures Europe, which operated Europe's leading open-outcry energy futures exchange. Since 2003, ICE has partnered with the Chicago Climate Exchange\n(CCX) to host its electronic marketplaces. In April 2005, the entire ICE portfolio of energy futures became fully electronic and ICE closed International Petroleum Exchange\n's high profile and historic trading floor.[5]\n\n","ICE became a publicly traded company on November 16, 2005, and was added to the Russell 1000 Index on June 30, 2006.

Another week later, ICE and Nasdaq sweetened their offer, including a $.17 increase per share to $42.67 and a $350 million breakup fee if the deal were to encounter regulatory trouble. The two said the offer was a $2 billion (21%) premium over the Deutsche offer and that they had fully committed financing of $3.8 billion from lenders to finance the deal.[20]\n\n","The Justice Department\n, also in April, \"initiated an antitrust review of the proposal, which would have brought nearly all U.S. stock listings under a merged Nasdaq-NYSE.\" In May, saying it \"became clear that we would not be successful in securing regulatory approval,\" the Nasdaq and ICE withdrew their bid.[21]\n\nThe European Commission\nthen blocked the Deutsche merger on 1 February 2012, citing the fact that the merged company would have a near monopoly.[22]\n\n[23]\n\n","In December 2012, ICE announced it would buy NYSE Euronext (this time without the involvement of Nasdaq) for $8.2 billion, pending regulatory approval.[24]\n\n[notes 1]\n\nJeffrey Sprecher will retain his position as Chairman and CEO.[25]\n\nThe boards of directors of both ICE and NYSE Euronext approved the acquisition.","In September 2014, ICE announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SuperDerivatives\n,[26]\n\na leading provider of risk management analytics, financial market data and valuation services.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94ded20262df3aa1b2f55c"},"content":{"contents":["Krystal\nis an American fast food\nrestaurant chain headquartered in Atlanta\n, Georgia\n.[5]\n\nIt is known for its small, square hamburger sliders\nwith steamed-in onions\n. Krystal moved its corporate headquarters from Chattanooga, Tennessee\n, where it had been based since 1932, to Atlanta in early 2013.[6]\n\n","","","Founded on October 11, 1932, in Chattanooga, Tennessee\n, during the first years of the Great Depression\n, entrepreneur\nRody Davenport Jr. and partner J. Glenn Sherrill theorized that even in a severe economic upheaval, \"People would patronize a restaurant that was kept spotlessly clean, where they could get a good meal with courteous service at the lowest possible price.\" The restaurant's first customer, French Jenkins, ordered six \"Krystals\" and a cup of coffee, all for the price of 35¢, thus proving their theory true.[7]\n\n","Davenport had visited White Castle\nrestaurants, taking notes of successful features, before setting forth on his own venture. Davenport and Sherrill set up the first Krystal at the corner of 7th and Cherry Streets in Chattanooga. The first Krystal was a modular building constructed in Chicago and shipped to Chattanooga for final installation. The oldest Krystal still in operation is located on Cherokee Boulevard in Chattanooga's Northshore District. Krystal is the seventh or eighth-oldest hamburger chain in the United States (the oldest being White Castle\n)[8]\n\nand the oldest in the South\n.","Regarding the origins of the Krystal name, company legend states that Davenport and his wife were riding down a mountain road when Mrs. Mary McGee Davenport saw a lawn ornament\nin the shape of a crystal ball\n. While gazing at the lawn ornament, Mrs. Davenport commented that since Davenport and Sherrill felt cleanliness was a cornerstone of the concept, they should name the restaurant Crystal for \"clean as a crystal\" - yet with a \"K\" to add a little twist.[8]\n\nKrystal's restaurants through the years often sported a crystal ball on the top.","From the early 1930s through the early 1960s, the chain served much of its food, not in take-out containers, but on inexpensive porcelain\ndish ware with the \"Krystal\" moniker. The waiters and waitresses wore white uniforms, and food was offered through counter service. In the 1950s, Krystal opened its first drive-through\nwindow - which most locations maintain today.[9]\n\nA 2013 study of seven fast food franchises found that service at Krystal drive-throughs was the slowest, with an average wait time of 218 seconds. It was, however the most accurate in terms of fulfilling orders.[10]\n\n","In the 1950s, cake doughnuts were served as a breakfast and dessert item. From about 1970 until 1986, \"bone-in\" kettle fried chicken and related sides were offered. These items were sometimes sold from a stand-alone addition to the hamburger restaurants.","DavCo, a division of Krystal, operated \"\u003eWendy's\nfranchises in the 1960s and 1970s. Between 1983 and 1988, DavCo also operated the title=\"Po' Folks (restaurant)\"\u003ePo' Folks\nfamily restaurant chain.[11]\n\n","Krystal restaurants, both company-owned and franchised, operate in Alabama\n, Florida\n, Georgia\n, Kentucky\n, Louisiana\n, Mississippi\n, South Carolina\n, and Tennessee\n. There is also a Krystal in Bristol, Virginia\n, (which lies on the Tennessee-Virginia border), one in West Memphis, Arkansas\n(directly across the Mississippi River\nfrom Memphis, Tennessee\n), and one in Murphy, North Carolina\n. Krystal has also operated several restaurants in Texas\nover the years. It is often compared to the Midwestern restaurant chain White Castle\n, and other than the South Central Kentucky and Nashville, Tennessee\nmarkets, the two restaurants' market areas do not generally overlap.","Krystal maintained its corporate headquarters in Chattanooga\nfrom 1932 to 2013, and has been owned by Argonne Capital Group since early 2012. Previously, Port Royal Holdings, Inc. owned the chain from 1997-2012, expanding the chain to a peak of over 420 locations in 11 states in 2002, before downsizing and closing dozens of locations. Ten new locations were added in 2011, 11 more in 2012-2013, and 25 more are planned for 2014 throughout the Southeast.","In the late 1990s, Krystal emerged from a bankruptcy proceeding and a sale of assets that placed majority ownership outside the heirs of the founding families. Krystal's period of structural change and uncertainty in the late 1990s has regenerated into a successfully reborn restaurant chain\nwith reported customer satisfaction\nand an evolving menu.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Krystal's product line centers on a square hamburger patty slider with a steamed bun, together with diced onions, pickle, and mustard, and collectively called a \"Krystal\". Small hot dogs\ncalled \"pups\" are also featured menu items. The chain has occasionally expanded its menu to include larger burgers, such as the \"Big Angus Burger,\" a full-size hamburger made of 100% Angus beef.","Krystal is known for a diverse breakfast menu, which includes a made-to-order country breakfast, meat and egg sandwiches, and biscuits, as well as other items. One particularly popular breakfast item is the Scrambler, which includes a layered stack of scrambled eggs\n, sausage\n, grits\n, and cheese\nserved in a styrofoam\ncup.[12]\n\nOther variations of the Scrambler also feature pancakes, sausage gravy, or southwestern-style spices.","In 1998, Krystal introduced the Krystal Chik, a fried chicken breast filet slider\nserved on the signature steamed square bun.[9]\n\nKrystal Chiks are extremely popular, along with other chicken\n, chili\n, and dessert\nitems. Krystal continues to focus on their core menu products, but is also in the process of redesigning and upgrading their stores to appeal to a mobile and multi-tasking audience.","In the mid 2000s Krystal tested a prototype for a new high-tech drive-in featuring individual television monitors for ordering and watching television (audio accessed via car stereo), and indoor and outdoor seating areas with multiple big-screen television monitors and free digital jukeboxes.[13]\n\nKrystal's website is interactive and supports mobile computing, and the Krystal Locator helps customers fulfill their \"Krystal Kraving\" wherever they might be in the Southeast.","Krystal restaurants are the host of the Krystal Square Off\n, a competitive eating contest. The current world record is 103 Krystal burgers consumed in 8 minutes by Joey Chestnut\n, set at the 2007 competition."],"title":"Krystal (restaurant)","rels":["/wiki/List_of_hamburger_restaurants","/wiki/List_of_coffeehouse_chains","/wiki/A%26W_Restaurants","/wiki/Arctic_Circle_Restaurants","/wiki/Back_Yard_Burgers","/wiki/Big_Boy_Restaurants","/wiki/BurgerFi","/wiki/Burger_King","/wiki/Cook_Out_(restaurant)","/wiki/Cheeburger_Cheeburger","/wiki/Dairy_Queen","/wiki/Fatburger","/wiki/Five_Guys","/wiki/Fuddruckers","/wiki/The_Habit_Burger_Grill","/wiki/Hwy_55_Burgers,_Shakes_%26_Fries","/wiki/In-N-Out_Burger","/wiki/Jack_in_the_Box","/wiki/Johnny_Rockets","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Red_Robin","/wiki/Roy_Rogers_Restaurants","/wiki/Shake_Shack","/wiki/Smashburger","/wiki/Sonic_Drive-In","/wiki/Wayback_Burgers","/wiki/Whataburger","/wiki/White_Castle_(restaurant)","/wiki/L%26L_Hawaiian_Barbecue","/wiki/Manchu_Wok","/wiki/Panda_Express","/wiki/Pei_Wei_Asian_Diner","/wiki/Pick_Up_Stix","/wiki/Au_Bon_Pain","/wiki/The_Cheesecake_Factory","/wiki/Cinnabon","/wiki/Corner_Bakery_Cafe","/wiki/Einstein_Bros._Bagels","/wiki/Great_American_Cookies","/wiki/Honey_Dew_Donuts","/wiki/Krispy_Kreme","/wiki/Mrs._Fields","/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_Toll_House_Caf%C3%A9","/wiki/Panera_Bread","/wiki/Pretzelmaker","/wiki/Shipley_Do-Nuts","/wiki/Tim_Hortons","/wiki/T.J._Cinnamons","/wiki/Argo_Tea","/wiki/Biggby_Coffee","/wiki/Caribou_Coffee","/wiki/The_Coffee_Bean_%26_Tea_Leaf","/wiki/Coffee_Beanery","/wiki/Dunn_Bros","/wiki/Jamba_Juice","/wiki/Juice_It_Up!","/wiki/Orange_Julius","/wiki/Planet_Smoothie","/wiki/Robeks","/wiki/Smoothie_King","/wiki/Starbucks","/wiki/Teavana","/wiki/Tropical_Smoothie_Cafe","/wiki/Baskin-Robbins","/wiki/Carvel_(restaurant)","/wiki/Cold_Stone_Creamery","/wiki/Dairy_Queen","/wiki/Fosters_Freeze","/wiki/Golden_Spoon","/wiki/H%C3%A4agen-Dazs","/wiki/Kiwi_Yogurt","/wiki/Marble_Slab_Creamery","/wiki/Pinkberry","/wiki/Red_Mango","/wiki/Sweet_Frog","/wiki/Tastee-Freez","/wiki/TCBY","/wiki/Tropical_Sno","/wiki/Tutti_Frutti_Frozen_Yogurt","/wiki/Yogen_Fr%C3%BCz","/wiki/Yogurtland","/wiki/Hot_Dog_on_a_Stick","/wiki/Wienerschnitzel","/wiki/Baja_Fresh","/wiki/Cafe_Rio","/wiki/Chipotle_Mexican_Grill","/wiki/Del_Taco","/wiki/El_Pollo_Loco","/wiki/Freebirds_World_Burrito","/wiki/Green_Burrito","/wiki/La_Salsa","/wiki/Pancheros_Mexican_Grill","/wiki/Qdoba","/wiki/Taco_Bell","/wiki/Taco_Bueno","/wiki/Taco_Cabana","/wiki/Taco_del_Mar","/wiki/Taco_Mayo","/wiki/Taco_Time","/wiki/Tijuana_Flats","/wiki/Noodles_%26_Company","/wiki/Skyline_Chili","/wiki/Atlanta_Bread_Company","/wiki/Blimpie","/wiki/Cos%C3%AC_(restaurant)","/wiki/Cousins_Subs","/wiki/Firehouse_Subs","/wiki/Great_Wraps","/wiki/Miami_Subs_Grill","/wiki/Penn_Station_(restaurant)","/wiki/Port_of_Subs","/wiki/Potbelly_Sandwich_Works","/wiki/Quiznos","/wiki/Rax_Roast_Beef","/wiki/Steak_Escape","/wiki/Subway_(restaurant)","/wiki/Which_Wich%3F","/wiki/H._Salt_Esquire","/wiki/Skippers_Seafood_%26_Chowder_House","/wiki/Burger_Chef","/wiki/Carrols_Restaurant_Group","/wiki/Hot_Sam_Pretzels","/wiki/Naugles","/wiki/Red_Barn_(restaurant)","/wiki/White_Tower_Hamburgers","/wiki/Zantigo","/wiki/AGCO","/wiki/Duluth,_Georgia","/wiki/American_Megatrends","/wiki/Gwinnett_County,_Georgia","/wiki/Sandy_Springs,_Georgia","/wiki/AT%26T_Mobility","/wiki/Atlanta_Bread_Company","/wiki/Smyrna,_Georgia","/wiki/Atlanta_Gas_Light","/wiki/BellSouth","/wiki/Chick-fil-A","/wiki/College_Park,_Georgia","/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company","/wiki/Cox_Enterprises","/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines","/wiki/EarthLink","/wiki/Equifax","/wiki/ExpressJet","/wiki/Georgia_Natural_Gas","/wiki/Georgia-Pacific","/wiki/Georgia_Power","/wiki/Holiday_Inn","/wiki/Holiday_Inn_Express","/wiki/The_Home_Depot","/wiki/Cobb_County,_Georgia","/wiki/Hooters","/wiki/Intercontinental_Exchange","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Kool_Smiles","/wiki/Marietta,_Georgia","/wiki/Merial","/wiki/NCR_Corporation","/wiki/Popeyes","/wiki/RaceTrac","/wiki/Rheem","/wiki/Scientific_Atlanta","/wiki/Lawrenceville,_Georgia","/wiki/Simmons_Bedding_Company","/wiki/Southern_Company","/wiki/SunTrust_Banks","/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System","/wiki/United_Parcel_Service","/wiki/Waffle_House","/wiki/The_Weather_Channel_(United_States)","/wiki/Krystal_(restaurant)","/wiki/Krystal_(restaurant)"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Krystal_(restaurant)"}

These kids had nowhere to go for years and years.\"[7]\n\nBrown said that originally they planned to open ten to fifteen clinics.[7]\n\n","By 2005, Kool Smiles had opened six clinics in Georgia and two in Indianapolis, Indiana, and it had plans to open new clinics in Massachusetts and Virginia. It accepted patients on Medicaid\nand state insurance plans and patients who did \"self-pay\". They did not accept private insurance.[2]\n\nIn 2007, it had 10 clinics in Georgia.[8]\n\nAround that year, it served 71,000 children annually at its Georgia clinics.[9]\n\nIn 2008, the chain had about 40 clinics in seven U.S. states.[10]\n\nIn 2009 it operated 84 clinics in the entire United States.[11]\n\n","After the WellCare and Peach State Medicaid networks followed through with plans to terminate Kool Smiles from their contracts, patients of Kool Smiles and another company filed an injunction that would prevent the terminations until WellCare and the Peach State organizations would show that the ending of the contracts would not contradict Medicaid dental program requirements.[12]\n\nKool Smiles' Chief Dental Officer, Dr. David Strange, argued that if it lost the contract, some families in Columbus, Georgia\n, would be unable to receive dental care. Kool Smiles remained part of the Amerigroup Medicaid network and later resumed participation in the WellCare and Peach State Medicaid networks. \u0026#160;Kool Smiles currently participates in all of the Medicaid networks in Georgia.[13]\n\n","In 2010 Kool Smiles generated $80 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(EBITDA). During that year the company hired Harris Williams\n, an investment bank, in order to sell itself.[14]\n\nThe company was said to be worth $700 million.[7]\n\nAs of October 4, 2010, American Securities LLC\nwas the lead bidder.[15]\n\nThe deal failed and the company was not sold.[7]\n\n","Kool Smiles has partnered with the Gary Community Health Center and the East Chicago Community Health Center to provide dental care in their facilities.[16]\n\nThe company has also partnered with the Governor of Maryland, Martin O’Malley\n, on his “Healthy Smiles Tour” to improve access to dental care in the state.[17]\n\n","In 2012, Frontline\n\naired a report saying that Kool Smiles inappropriately used crowns on young patients instead of regular fillings, because Medicaid bills more for crowns, and that the company pressured dentists to go along with the usage of crowns to make more money for the company.[7]\n\nFrontline later admitted their analysis showed that Kool Smiles in fact provided 25% fewer crowns per patient (2.1 vs. 2.8) than the average dentist.[18]\n\nKool Smiles responded by saying that, \"Dentists do not receive revenue, patient or procedure targets or scorecards.\"[19]\n\nKool Smiles pointed to a study authored by presidential economist Arthur Laffer, which reviewed Texas Medicaid claims data and concluded that, in 2011, Kool Smiles charged less and performed fewer procedures, including crowns, per patient than other Medicaid dental providers in the state.[20]\n\nThe company said, \"Unfortunately, Frontline\nignores what all dentists know – children with long-neglected dental needs require more medical care.\"[21]\n\nLater it was revealed Frontline\nhad used a former employee as their \"whistleblower\" who was a convicted felon, who was suing the company after being terminated for falsifying documents.[22]\n\n","Slate\nran a feature about dental care in Alabama\nduring 2015, explaining that the work by companies such as Kool Smiles was assisting with assisting some of the poorest children in the country with their dental care.[23]\n\nAround the same time, a number of studies were carried out regarding the adoption of Dental Service Organizations\nfor many states. As one of the leading providers of DSOs in the United States, Kool Smiles' statistics were regularly quoted during this period. The result of regular care through DSOs meant that Kool Smiles' patients had an overall average monthly Medicaid\nexpenditure that was 33% lower than non-Kool Smiles patients and that Kool Smiles providers perform 15 percent fewer procedures per patient.[24]\n\n","The company headquarters are located in the Kool Smiles Patient Support Center in Suite 290 of the Northchase Office Park building in Marietta\n, Georgia\n, U.S., in Greater Atlanta\n.[25]\n\n[26]\n\nAt one time its headquarters were in Suite 440 of Building 400 of the Atlanta Technology Center\nin Atlanta\n.[27]\n\n[28]\n\nAt a later time its headquarters were in Suite 800 of the Galleria 400 building in unincorporated\nCobb County\n.[26]\n\n[29]\n\n[30]\n\n","The company says that its mission is to provide quality dental care for children and families in underserved communities.

The check-ups came as part of a government initiative, with the treatment being the first dental treatment the children had received in many cases. By 2011, two million patients visited Kool Smiles clinics.[31]\n\n","As part of Kool Smiles' work in South Carolina\n, the percentage of Medicaid-enrolled children receiving dental services increased from 46.9 percent to 51.9 percent. The statistics were announced in 2011 when the dental practice opened its seventh clinic in the state.[34]\n\n","A study conducted in 2015 by Dobson DaVanzo concluded states could save more than $550 million annually in Medicaid expenditures provided care as conservatively as Kool Smiles,[35]\n\nwhich does 25% fewer services at a 37% lower cost than others providing care to the same patient population.[36]\n\n"],"title":"Kool Smiles","rels":["/wiki/All_Smiles_Dental_Centers","/wiki/Aspen_Dental","/wiki/Medicaid_Dental_Center","/wiki/ReachOut_Healthcare_America","/wiki/Small_Smiles_Dental_Centers","/wiki/South_Texas_Dental","/wiki/Delta_Dental","/wiki/Friedman_Fleischer_%26_Lowe","/wiki/Friedman_Fleischer_%26_Lowe","/wiki/Kool_Smiles","/wiki/Kool_Smiles"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Kool_Smiles"}

The 2013 estimate is 59,089, making it one of Atlanta\n's largest suburbs\n. Marietta is the fourth largest of the principal cities (by population) of the Atlanta\nmetropolitan statistical area\n.[5]\n\n[6]\n\n","","","The origin of the name is uncertain. It is believed that the city was named for Mary Cobb, the wife of U.S. Senator\nand Superior Court\njudge Thomas Willis Cobb\n. Judge Cobb is the namesake of the county.[7]\n\n","Homes were built by early settlers near the Cherokee\ntown of Big Shanty\n(now Kennesaw\n) prior to 1824.[8]\n\nThe first plat was laid out in 1833. Like most towns, Marietta had a square (see Marietta Square\n) in the center with a courthouse. The Georgia General Assembly\nlegally recognized the community on December 19, 1834.[8]\n\n","Built in 1838, Oakton House[9]\n\nis the oldest continuously occupied residence in Marietta. The original barn, milk house, smokehouse, and wellhouse remain on the property. The spectacular gardens contain the boxwood parterre\nfrom the 1870s. Oakton served as Major General Loring\n's headquarters during the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain\nin 1864.[10]\n\n","Marietta was initially selected as the hub for the new Western and Atlantic Railroad\n, and business boomed.[8]\n\nBy 1838, roadbed and trestles had been built north of the city. However, in 1840, political wrangling stopped construction for a time. In 1842, the railroad's new management decided to move the hub from Marietta to an area that would become Atlanta. Nonetheless, in 1850, when the railroad began operation, Marietta shared in the resulting prosperity.[8]\n\n","Businessman and politician John Glover arrived in 1848. A popular figure, Glover was elected mayor when the city incorporated in 1852.[8]\n\nAnother early resident was Carey Cox, a physician, who promoted a \"water cure\", which developed into a spa\nthat attracted patients to the area. The Cobb County Medical Society recognizes him as the county's first physician.[8]\n\n","The Georgia Military Institute\nwas built in 1851, and the first bank opened in 1855.[8]\n\nDuring the 1850s, fire destroyed much of the city on three separate occasions.[8]\n\n","By the time the Civil War\nbegan in 1861, Marietta had recovered from the fires.[8]\n\n","In April 1862, James Andrews, a civilian working with the Union Army\n, came to Marietta, along with a small party of Union soldiers dressed in civilian clothing. The group spent the night in the Fletcher House hotel (later known as the Kennesaw House\nand now the home of the Marietta Museum of History) located immediately in front of the Western and Atlantic Railroad. Andrews and his men, who later became known as the Andrews Raiders\n, planned to seize a train and proceed north toward the city of Chattanooga\n, destroying the railroad on their way. They hoped, in so doing, to isolate Chattanooga from Atlanta and bring about the downfall of the Confederate stronghold. The Raiders boarded a waiting train on the morning of April 12, 1862, along with other passengers. Shortly thereafter, the train made a scheduled stop in the town of Big Shanty, now known as Kennesaw. When the other passengers got off the train for breakfast, Andrews and the Raiders stole the engine and the car behind it, which carried the fuel. The engine, called The General\n\n, and Andrews' Raiders had begun the episode now known as the Great Locomotive Chase\n.[8]\n\nAndrews and the Raiders failed in their mission. Andrews and all of his men were caught within two weeks, including two men who had arrived late and missed the hijacking. All were tried as spies, convicted, and hanged.[11]\n\n","General William Tecumseh Sherman\ninvaded the town during the Atlanta Campaign\nin the summer of 1864. In November 1864, General Hugh Kilpatrick\nset the town ablaze, the first strike in le=\"Sherman's March to the Sea\"\u003eSherman's March to the Sea\n.[8]\n\nSherman's troops crossed the Chattahoochee River\nat a shallow section known as the Palisades, after burning the Marietta Paper Mills near the mouth of Sope Creek\n.","The Marietta Confederate Cemetery\n, with the graves of over 3,000 Confederate soldiers killed during the Battle of Atlanta, is located in the city.[12]\n\n","In 1892, the city established a public school system\n. It included a high school for white students\nand a separate high school for blacks.[13]\n\n","Leo Frank\nwas lynched\nat 1200 Roswell Road just east of Marietta on August 17, 1915. Frank, a Jewish-American\nsuperintendent of the National Pencil Company in Atlanta, had been convicted on August 25, 1913, for the murder of one of his factory workers, 13-year-old Mary Phagan\n. The murder and trial, sensationalized\nin the local press, portrayed Frank as depraved, and captured the public's attention. An eleventh-hour commutation of Frank's death sentence to life imprisonment created great local outrage. A mob, systematically organized for the purpose, abducted Frank from prison, drove him to Marietta, and hanged him. The leaders of the abduction included past, current, and future, elected local, county and state officials. There were two state legislators, the mayor, a former governor, a clergyman, two former Superior Court justices, and an ex-sheriff. One of the results of this was the creation of the Anti-Defamation League.[14]\n\n","Marietta is located near the center of Cobb County, between Kennesaw\nto the northwest and Smyrna\nto the southeast.

Nuti\n(Chairman, President \u0026amp; CEO)\n","The NCR Corporation\n(originally National Cash Register\n) is an American computer hardware\n, software\nand electronics\ncompany that makes self-service kiosks, point-of-sale terminals\n, automated teller machines\n, check\nprocessing systems, barcode scanners\n, and business consumables. They also provide IT maintenance support services. NCR had been based in Dayton, Ohio\n, starting in 1884, but in June 2009 the company sold most of the Dayton properties and moved its headquarters to the Atlanta metropolitan area\nin unincorporated\nGwinnett County, Georgia\n, near Duluth\nand Alpharetta\n.[4]\n\n[5]\n\nIn early January 2018, the new NCR Global Headquarters opened in Midtown Atlanta\nnear Technology Square\n(adjacent to the Georgia Institute of Technology\n).","NCR was founded in 1884 and acquired by AT\u0026amp;T\nin 1991. A restructuring of AT\u0026amp;T in 1996 led to NCR's re-establishment January 1,1997 as a separate company and involved the spin-off\nof Lucent Technologies\nfrom AT\u0026amp;T.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nNCR is the only AT\u0026amp;T spin-off company that has retained its original name—all the others have either been purchased or renamed following subsequent mergers.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","","","The company began as the National Manufacturing Company\nof Dayton, Ohio, was established to manufacture and sell the first mechanical cash register\ninvented in 1879 by James Ritty\n. In 1884, the company and patents were bought by John Henry Patterson\n\nand his brother Frank Jefferson Patterson, and the firm was renamed the National Cash Register Company\n. Patterson formed NCR into one of the first modern American companies by introducing new, aggressive sales methods and business techniques. He established the first sales training school in 1893 and introduced a comprehensive social welfare program for his factory workers.","Other significant figures in the early history of the company were Thomas J. Watson, Sr.\n, Charles F. Kettering\nand Edward A. Deeds\n.","Watson\n—fired by Patterson in 1914—eventually worked his way up to general sales manager. At an uninspiring sales meeting, Watson interrupted, saying The trouble with every one of us is that we don't think enough. We don't get paid for working with our feet — we get paid for working with our heads\n. Watson then wrote THINK\n\non the easel.[6]\n\nSigns with this motto were later erected in NCR factory buildings, sales offices and club rooms during the mid-1890s. \"THINK\" later became a widely known symbol of IBM, which was created by Watson after he joined the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR)\n.[7]\n\n","Kettering\ndesigned the first cash register powered by an electric motor in 1906. Within a few years he developed the Class 1000 register which was in production for 40 years, and the O.K. Telephone Credit Authorization system for verifying credit in department stores.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Deeds and Kettering went on to found Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company\nwhich later became Delco Products Division of General Motors\n.","When John H. Patterson and his brother took over the company, cash registers were expensive ($50 USD) and only about a dozen of \"Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier\" machines were in use. There was little demand for the expensive device, but Patterson believed the product would sell once shopkeepers understood it would drastically decrease theft by salesclerks. He created a sales team known as the \"American Selling Force\" which worked on commissions and followed a standard sales script, the \"N.C.R. Primer.\" The philosophy was to sell a business function rather than just a piece of machinery. Sales demonstrations were set up in hotels (away from the distractions of the buyer's business) depicting a store interior complete with real merchandise and real cash. The sale prospect was described as the \"P.P.\" or \"Probable Purchaser.\" Once initial objections were swept aside and the P.P. admitted to internal theft losses, the product was demonstrated along with large business charts and diagrams. The deal was sealed with a 25 cent cigar.[8]\n\n","NCR expanded quickly and became multi-national in 1888. Between 1893 and 1906 it acquired a number of smaller cash register companies.[9]\n\n","By 1911 it had sold one million machines and grown to almost 6,000 employees. Combined with rigorous legal attacks, Patterson's methods enabled the company to fight off bankruptcy, buy-out over 80 of its early competitors, and achieve control of 95% of the U.S. market.","In 1912 the company was found guilty of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act\n. Patterson, Deeds, Watson and 25 other NCR executives and managers were convicted of illegal anti-competitive sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Their convictions were unpopular with the public due to the efforts of Patterson and Watson to help those affected by the Dayton, Ohio floods of 1913\n, but efforts to have them pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson\nwere unsuccessful. However, their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1915 on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted.","Two million units were sold by 1922, the year John Patterson died. In 1925, NCR went public with an issue of $55 million in stock, at that time the largest public offering in United States history. During the first World War, NCR manufactured fuses and aircraft instrumentation, and during World War II\nbuilt aero-engines, bomb sights and code-breaking machines, including the American bombe\ndesigned by Joseph Desch\n.","Building on its wartime experience with secret communication systems, high speed counters and cryptanalytic equipment,[10]\n\nNCR became a major post-war force in developing new computing and communications technology.","In 1953 chemists Barrett K. Green and Lowell Schleicher of NCR in Dayton submitted a patent \"Pressure responsive record materials\" for a carbon-less copy paper. This became US Patent 2,730,457 and was commercialized as \"NCR Paper\n.\"","In February 1953, the company acquired the Computer Research Corporation (CRC)\n,[11]\n\nafter which it created a specialized electronics division. In 1956, NCR introduced its first electronic device, the Class 29 Post-Tronic, a bank machine using magnetic stripe\ntechnology. With the General Electric Company (now known as GE\n), the company manufactured its first transistor\n-based computer in 1957, the NCR 304\n. Also in the 1950s NCR introduced MICR (magnetic ink character recognition\n)[12]\n\nand the NCR 3100 accounting machines.[13]\n\n","In 1962, NCR introduced the NCR-315\nElectronic Data Processing System which included the CRAM\nstorage device, the first automated mass storage\nalternative to magnetic tape\nlibraries accessed manually by computer operators. The NCR 390\nand 500\ncomputers were also offered to customers who did not need the full power of the 315. The NCR 390 accepted four types of input: magnetic ledger cards, punched cards, punched tape, and keyboard entry, with a tape read speed of 400 characters a second.[13]\n\nThe company's first all-integrated circuit\ncomputer was the Century 100\nof 1968. The Century 200 was added in 1970. The line was extended through the Century 300.[14]\n\nThe Century series was followed by the Criterion series in 1976, NCR's first virtual machine system.","During this period, NCR also produced the 605 minicomputer for in-house use. It was the compute engine for the 399 and 499 accounting machines, several generations of in-store and in-bank controllers, and the 82xx/90xx IMOS COBOL systems. The 605 also powered peripheral controllers, including the 658 disk subsystem and the 721 communications processor.","By 1986, the number of mainframe makers had dropped from 8 (IBM and the \"seven dwarfs\") to 6 (IBM and the \"BUNCH\n\") to 4: IBM, Unisys\n, NCR, and Control Data Corporation\n.","The company adopted the name NCR Corporation\nin 1974.","In 1982, NCR became involved in open systems architecture\n. Its first such system was the UNIX\n-powered TOWER 16/32, the success of which (approximately 100,000 were sold) established NCR as a pioneer in bringing industry standards and open systems architecture to the computer market. These 5000-series systems were based on Motorola\n68k\nCPUs\nand supported NCR's proprietary transaction processing system\nTMX\n, which was mainly used by financial institutions. This product line also saw the first time NCR had offered its products through other than its own direct sales channels since the early 1900s. Formally added to its company structure in March 1984, NCR's OEM System's Division spearheaded the design, sales revenue and market awareness and acceptance of NCR's Tower family. Part of the cause of this success was the decision by NCR senior management to hire reseller industry veterans for key positions within the fledgling operation and have that unit work with, but not answerable to, NCR's traditional management structure. The industry shift from minicomputers brought personnel with minicomputer and reseller backgrounds such as the division head, Dan Kiegler (ex-Datapoint marketing), marketing manager and later Director of Field Sales, Dave Lang (ex-DEC reseller marketing director and salesperson) and other critical contributors at corporate levels; who then hired a complementary field sales organization primarily made up of proven people from DEC, Wang and other faltering minicomputer firms.","In the 1980s, NCR sold various PC compatible\nAT\n-class computers, like the small NCR-3390 (called an \"intelligent terminal\"). They proposed a customized version of MS-DOS\nnamed NCR-DOS\n, which for example offered support for switching the CPU between 6, 8 or 10\u0026#160;MHz speeds. The computers featured an improved CGA\nadapter, the NGA, which had a 640×400 text mode more suitable for business uses than the original 640×200 mode, with characters drawn using single-pixel-wide lines, giving an appearance similar to that of classic IBM 3270 terminals. The additional four-color 640×400 graphical mode was identical to CGA's 320×200 mode from a programming point of view.","NCR also manufactured two proprietary series of mini-to-midrange computers:","I-Series: 9010 (IDPS Operating System), 9020 and 9100 (IMOS Operating System), 9040 and 9050 (IRX Operating System), 9200 / 9300 / 9300IP / 9400 / 9400IP / 9500 / System 1000 models 35 / 55 / 65 / 75 (ITX Operating System). These were \"I\" (Interactive) computers allowing TTY terminals to be connected. Later models supported all industry-standard communication protocols.","V-Series: 8500 (VRX Operating System) and 9800 (VRX/E Operating System). These were \"V\" series, comparable to mainframes, supporting \"Page mode\" terminals. The hardware did have similarities with the I-Series while the operating system and user interface was totally different.","In 1990, NCR introduced the System 3000, a seven-level family of computers based on Intel\n's 386\nand 486\nCPUs. The majority of the System 3000 range utilised IBM's Micro Channel architecture\nrather than the more prevalent ISA architecture, and utilised SCSI\nperipherals as well as the more popular parallel and serial port interfaces, resulting in a premium product with premium pricing. The 3600, through NCR subsidiary Applied Digital Data Systems\nsupported both the Pick Operating System\nand Prime Information\n.[15]\n\n","The 1970s saw the widespread installations of the Model 770 in National Westminster\nand Barclays\nbanks throughout the UK, but it was not until the Model 5070, developed at its Dundee\nplant in Scotland\nand introduced in 1983 that the company began to make more serious inroads into the ATM market. Subsequent models included the 5084, and 58xx\n(Personas) series. In early 2008, the company launched its new generation of ATMs—the 662x/663x SelfServ series. NCR currently commands over a third of the entire ATM market, with an estimated $18 trillion being withdrawn from NCR ATMs every year. In addition, NCR's expertise in this field led the company to contract with the U.S. Military\nto support the Eagle Cash\nprogram with customized ATMs.[16]\n\n","The NCR 5xxx\n-series is the range of (ATM's) produced by NCR from the early 1980s. Most models were designed and initially manufactured at its Dundee\nfactory in Scotland\n, but later produced at several other locations around the world.","There have been several distinct generations:","NCR's 6th generation of ATMs have been noted for the further move towards intelligent deposit and the expansion of secondary functions such as barcode reading.","NCR's latest ATM services, introduced in 2008.","This series is a complete redesign of both outlook and technological contents. It is also a cost down product.","Self-Serv 20 series are single-function (e.g. cash-out) ATMs, while Self-Serv 30 series are full-function (cash-out and intelligent deposit) machines.","NCR was acquired September 19, 1991 by AT\u0026amp;T Corporation\nfor $7.4 billion and was joined with Teradata Corporation\non February 28, 1992. As an AT\u0026amp;T subsidiary, its 1992 year-end headcount was 53,800 employees and contractors.[17]\n\nBy 1993, the subsidiary produced a year-end $1.287 billion net loss\non $7.265 billion in revenue. The net losses continued in 1994 and 1995, losses that required repeated subsidies from the parent company and resulted in a 1995 year-end headcount of 41,100.[17]\n\nDuring these three years, AT\u0026amp;T was the former NCR's largest customer, accounting for over $1.5 billion in revenue.[17]\n\n","On February 15, 1995, the company sold its microelectronics division and storage systems division to Hyundai\nwhich named it Symbios Logic\n. At the time it was the largest purchase of an American company by a Korean company.","For a while, starting in 1994, the subsidiary was renamed AT\u0026amp;T Global Information Solutions\n, but in 1995, AT\u0026amp;T decided to spin off the company, and in 1996, changed its name back to NCR in preparation for the spin-off\n. The company outlined its reasons for the spin-off in an Information Statement sent to its stockholders, which cited, in addition to \"changes in customer needs\" and \"need for focused management time and attention\", the following:","NCR re-emerged as a stand-alone company on January 1, 1997.","One of NCR's first significant acquisitions after becoming independent from AT\u0026amp;T came in July 1997, when it purchased Compris Technologies, a privately held company in Kennesaw, Georgia\nthat produced software for restaurant chains.[18]\n\nIn November 1997, NCR purchased Dataworks Inc., a 60-person privately held company in San Antonio, Texas\n.[19]\n\n","The Montgomery County Historical Society\nand NCR Corporation joined in 1998 into a partnership committed to preserving the historic and voluminous NCR Archive. In 1999, NCR moved an estimated three million items from NCR's Building 28 into the Historical Society's Research Center.","In 1998, NCR sold its computer hardware manufacturing assets to Solectron\nand ceased to produce general-purpose computer systems, focusing instead on the retail and financial industries. In 2000, NCR acquired customer relationship management\nprovider Ceres Integrated Solutions and services company 4Front Technologies\n. Recent acquisitions include self-service companies Kinetics\n, InfoAmerica and Galvanon, and software company DecisionPoint.","In April 2003, NCR purchased Copient Technologies\n, an Indiana-based retail marketing software company.","In 2006, NCR acquired software company IDVelocity and the ATM manufacturing division of Tidel, a cash security equipment manufacturer specializing in retail markets.","On January 8, 2007, NCR announced its intention to separate into two independent companies by spinning off Teradata\nto shareholders. Bill Nuti\nwould continue his role as president and CEO of NCR, while Teradata Senior VP Mike Koehler would assume leadership of Teradata.[20]\n\nOn October 1, 2007, NCR Corporation and Teradata jointly announced the Teradata business unit spin-off was complete, with Michael Koehler as the first CEO of Teradata.[21]\n\n","On January 11, 2007, NCR announced plans to restructure its entire ATM manufacturing operations, with 650 jobs at its Dundee plant being cut.[22]\n\nA further 450 jobs were cut in Waterloo\n, Ontario, Canada. In 2009, the Dundee manufacturing facility was closed, along with plants in São Paulo\nand Bucharest\n, citing global economic conditions as the reason.","NCR extended its self-service portfolio into the digital media market with the January 2007 announcement of NCR Xpress Entertainment, a multichannel entertainment kiosk. NCR’s acquisition of Touch Automation LLC was announced on December 31, 2007.[23]\n\n","On October 15, 2008, NCR announced a global reseller partnership with Experticity\n, a Seattle\nbased software company.[24]\n\n","In 2009, NCR relocated its corporate headquarters from Dayton, Ohio to near Duluth, Georgia\n; Dayton had served as NCR's home for 125 years.[25]\n\n","In 2009, NCR became the second largest DVD Kiosk operator in North America with the acquisitions of The New Release and DVD Play. In 2010, NCR completed the acquisition of digital signage company, Netkey.","In August 2011, NCR purchased Radiant Systems\n, a hospitality and retail systems company, for US$1.2 billion.[26]\n\nRadiant's hospitality division turned into a new Hospitality Line of Business within NCR. Radiant's petroleum and convenience retail business became part of its retail line of business. Several Radiant executives remained on board, including Scott Kingsfield, who was a general manager of NCR's Retail Line of Business and left NCR in 2014, and Andy Heyman, who became general manager of NCR's Financial Services line of business.","In August 2012, the company was hit with charges of avoiding U.S. economic sanctions\nagainst Syria\n, greatly affecting its stock price.[27]\n\n","In February 2013, NCR completed its acquisition of Retalix\n(NASDAQ: RTLX), a provider of retail software and services, for approximately $650 million in cash.[28]\n\n","In January 2014, NCR completed its acquisition of Digital Insight\nCorporation, a provider of online and mobile banking to mid-market financial institutions, from equity firm Thoma Bravo\n, LLC for $1.65 billion in cash.[29]\n\n","In September 2016, Mark Benjamin was named president and chief operating officer of NCR. Benjamin is a 24-year veteran of human resources management and will report directly to Bill Nuti.[30]\n\n","In January 2018, NCR relocated its corporate headquarters from Duluth, Georgia\nto a new office in Midtown Atlanta\n.","NCR's R\u0026amp;D activity is split between its three major centers in Atlanta\n(retail); Dundee, Scotland\n(financial industry); and Waterloo, Ontario\n.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94dee20262df3aa1b2f561"},"content":{"contents":["Popeyes\nis an American multinational chain of fried chicken\nfast food\nrestaurants founded in 1972 in New Orleans\n, Louisiana\n. Since 2008, its full brand name is Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc.\n[2]\n\nand it was formerly named Popeyes Chicken \u0026amp; Biscuits\n[3]\n\nand Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken \u0026amp; Biscuits\n.[4]\n\nIt is currently a subsidiary of Restaurant Brands International\n.","According to a company press release dated June 29, 2007, Popeyes is the second-largest \"quick-service chicken restaurant group, measured by number of units\", after KFC\n.[5]\n\nMore than 2,600 Popeyes restaurants are in more than 40 states and the District of Columbia\n, Puerto Rico\n, and 30 countries worldwide.[6]\n\nAbout thirty locations are company-owned, the rest franchised\n.[7]\n\n","","","Popeyes Mighty Chicken was founded in Arabi, Louisiana\n, a suburb of New Orleans\nin St. Bernard Parish\n. It first opened its doors on June 12, 1972, as \"Chicken on the Run\".[8]\n\nOwner Al Copeland\nwanted to compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken\n. As the company's history states, it sold \"traditional mild fried chicken [but] business was slow, and the chicken team realized they'd have to sell a spicier alternative to their standard chicken recipe if they wanted to impress flavor-seeking New Orleanians.\" Copeland started franchising his restaurant in 1976, beginning in Baton Rouge, Louisiana\n. Over the next ten years it added approximately 500 outlets. B.P. Newman\nof Laredo, Texas\n, acquired several franchises in Texas and surrounding states. Two hundred additional locations were added during a period of slower expansion.","By 1990, Copeland Enterprises was in default on $391 million in debts, and in April 1991, the company filed for bankruptcy\nprotection. In October 1992, the court approved a plan by a group of Copeland's creditors that resulted in the creation of America's Favorite Chicken Company, Inc. (AFC) to serve as the new parent company for Popeyes and e=\"Church's Chicken\"\u003eChurch's\n, another fast food chain specializing in chicken.[9]\n\nAFC went public in 2001 with initial public offering (IPO) of $142,818,479.[10]\n\nOn December 29, 2004, AFC sold Church's to Arcapita\n, formerly Crescent Capital Investments, retaining Popeyes.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","On June 17, 2014, Popeyes announced it had re-acquired full control of its seasonings, recipes, and other proprietary food preparation techniques from Diversified Foods \u0026amp; Seasonings, which remained under the control of Al Copeland and his estate after the creditor sale of Popeyes to AFC. Popeyes had continued to license the seasonings, recipes, and techniques from DF\u0026amp;S for a yearly 'spice royalty', before buying them outright for $43 million. DFS remains the main supplier for Popeyes until at least 2029.[11]\n\n","As of 2017[update]\n\n, Popeyes has over 2,600 restaurants worldwide according to its website.[3]\n\n","Alvin C. Copeland claimed he named the stores after the fictional detective\nJimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle\nin the movie The French Connection\n\n[12]\n\n[13]\n\nand not the comic strip\nand cartoon character Popeye the Sailor\n.","The name is spelled \"Popeyes\" without the apostrophe\nused by other restaurant chains such as McDonald's\nand ee's\n. Copeland claimed facetiously that he was \"too poor\" to afford an apostrophe.[12]\n\nThe chain later acquired rights to use Popeye the Sailor for marketing. The company's early brand became deeply tied to the cartoon star with its sponsorship of the Popeye \u0026amp; Pals\nchildren's show in New Orleans, and the character appeared on items from packaging to racing boats. In late November 2006, AFC announced the mutual termination of their licensing contract with King Features Syndicate\n, effectively ending their association with the Popeye characters.[14]\n\n","On February 21, 2017, Restaurant Brands International\nannounced a deal to buy Popeyes for US$1.8 billion.[15]\n\nOn March 27, 2017, the deal closed with RBI purchasing Popeyes at $79 per share via Orange, Inc, an indirect subsidiary of RBI.[16]\n\n","Popeyes serves chicken dishes in mild and spicy flavors and offers sides such as red beans and rice, Cajun fries\n, mashed potatoes with Cajun-style gravy, Cajun rice\n, macaroni \u0026amp; cheese\n, and coleslaw\n. In addition to fried chicken, other entree items include a chicken-and-sausage jambalaya\nand Most combo meals come with a side order\n, drink, and a biscuit\n. On October 30, 2006, AFC announced that Popeyes planned to introduce a trans fat\n-free biscuit as well as french fries containing one gram of trans fat by year-end.[17]\n\nOn November 18, 2011, AFC announced that, for the Thanksgiving\nholiday, Popeyes would release a Fried Turducken sandwich that would show off the first ever Turducken\npatty. On July 29, 2013, AFC began offering a special entree of fried chicken strips dipped in waffle batter, which was already a proven success in some markets.[18]\n\nFor a limited time only in 2017, Popeyes offered \"Sweet and Crunchy\" chicken, fried chicken tenders coated in shortbread cookie breading.[19]\n\n\nStyle and marketing\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColeslaw from Popeyes Chicken \u0026amp; Biscuits restaurant\n\n\nThe restaurants have a distinctive red-and-yellow color scheme. The original locations had a black lava rock exterior with a red shingled roof. Most older locations have covered the rock exterior to conform with the current yellow stucco appearance. During the 1970s and 1980s, the company occasionally licensed characters from the Popeye\ncomic strip to use in its advertising. TV and radio ads often use New Orleans-style music, along with the trademark \"Love That Chicken\" jingle[20]\n\nsung by New Orleans funk\nand R\u0026amp;B\nmusician Dr. John\n.\nIn 2009, Popeyes introduced \"Annie the Chicken Queen\", a fictitious, upbeat, African-American\nPopeyes chef. The character is meant to be \"honest, vibrant, youthful and authentic\" according to Dick Lynch, Popeyes Chief Marketing Officer. \"Everyone has a relative or a good friend who will give it to them straight, and that's what the Annie is all about\", Lynch said.[21]\n\n\nNumber of franchises\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nPopeyes maintains a \"Hall of Fame\" of its franchise holders. Among the inductees is Morgan W. Walker, Jr.\n(1928–2008), originally from Alexandria, Louisiana\n, who held a franchise in the Washington, D.C.\n, area from 1979 to 2007.

The original locations had a black lava rock exterior with a red shingled roof. Most older locations have covered the rock exterior to conform with the current yellow stucco appearance. During the 1970s and 1980s, the company occasionally licensed characters from the Popeye\ncomic strip to use in its advertising. TV and radio ads often use New Orleans-style music, along with the trademark \"Love That Chicken\" jingle[20]\n\nsung by New Orleans funk\nand R\u0026amp;B\nmusician Dr. John\n.","In 2009, Popeyes introduced \"Annie the Chicken Queen\", a fictitious, upbeat, African-American\nPopeyes chef. The character is meant to be \"honest, vibrant, youthful and authentic\" according to Dick Lynch, Popeyes Chief Marketing Officer. \"Everyone has a relative or a good friend who will give it to them straight, and that's what the Annie is all about\", Lynch said.[21]\n\n","Popeyes maintains a \"Hall of Fame\" of its franchise holders. Among the inductees is Morgan W. Walker, Jr.\n(1928–2008), originally from Alexandria, Louisiana\n, who held a franchise in the Washington, D.C.\n, area from 1979 to 2007. Some international franchises, such as the ones located in Germany\n, France\n, and Japan\n, are only located on U.S. military installations and are generally not accessible to the local civilian public."],"title":"Popeyes","rels":["/wiki/Cheryl_Bachelder","/wiki/List_of_fast-food_chicken_restaurants","/wiki/Wayback_Machine","/wiki/Wayback_Machine","/wiki/Chicken_Cottage","/wiki/Dixy_Chicken","/wiki/Kenny_Rogers_Roasters","/wiki/KFC","/wiki/Pollo_Campero","Undefined

The firm is Georgia\n's third largest private company, with sales of $9.1 billion in 2013.[1]\n\n","","","The company was founded by Carl Bolch Sr. in 1934 in St. Louis\n, Missouri\n, with his first stores operating under the name Carl Bolch Trackside Stations. In 1959, Bolch relocated and acquired the Oil Well Company of Opp, Alabama\n, which consisted of numerous independent outlets across rural Alabama\n.","His son, Carl Bolch Jr., who succeeded his father as chief executive\n, joined the company in Montgomery, Alabama\nin 1967. After pioneering the concept of self-service\ngasoline in Alabama, Florida\n, and Georgia, the company relocated its headquarters in 1976 to Atlanta, Georgia, and adopted the brand \"RaceTrac\" for its company-operated stations. RaceWay stations, operated by contractors, continue as a part of RaceTrac Petroleum.","In the 1990s RaceTrac operated as a cash-only business, but now accepts credit cards\n, debit cards\nand fleet cards\n.","In October 2012, Carl Bolch Jr. announced he would be passing the CEO title to his daughter, Allison Bolch Moran, while remaining Chairman of the Board. The change went into effect December 31, 2012.[2]\n\n","RaceTrac Petroleum, Inc. operates more than 650 retail gasoline convenience stores in 12 southeastern states under the RaceTrac (company-operated) and RaceWay (Contract Operator-operated) names.

Rheem also acquired the Republic Steel package company, which also had a plant in Richmond.[8]\n\nRepublic Steel made boilers and tanks, which allowed Rheem to enter the business of water heating. The company acquired the John Wood Manufacturing Company of California, which produced automatic gas storage water heaters, in 1931.[8]\n\nThe company expanded overseas to Australia in 1936, building a plant in Sydney\n.[8]\n\n[10]\n\nThe Australian operation began making steel shipping containers\n, including drums, in 1937 and water heaters in 1939.[8]\n\n","In 1941, the company became the largest manufacturer of automatic water heaters in the United States.[8]\n\nDuring World War II\n, much of the company's efforts went towards wartime production, including building ships and aircraft parts.[4]\n\n[8]\n\nIn 1954, Rheem brought the introduction of \"glass-lining\n\", which coated the interior of a water heater tank with porcelain to extend the life of the tank.[8]\n\nOne of the most significant events came in 1956 with the introduction of \"Rheemaire\" central air conditioning and heater systems for homes. This eventually became one of the company's primary business areas.[8]\n\nIn 1959, Rheem purchased the Ruud Manufacturing Company.[8]\n\n[11]\n\n","Beginning in August 1970, Rheem began producing Heat pumps\nand HVAC\nunits for residential applications, based in Fort Smith, Arkansas\n.[8]\n\n[9]\n\nIn 1983, Rheem introduced the Richmond Water Heaters brand to the market, aimed at hardware stores\nand home-improvement centers\n.[8]\n\nIn 1984, Rheem was acquired by Pace Industries, Inc.[8]\n\nThe company discontinued containers in 1985, ending a 60-year run making steel drums and other containers.[8]\n\nIn the same year, the company acquired Raypak, Inc., which expanded the business into swimming pool heaters as well as commercial boilers.[8]\n\nIn 1988 Rheem was acquired by Paloma Industries, Ltd., a privately held Japanese company with headquarters in Nagoya, Japan, which wished to expand globally.[8]\n\n[9]\n\n[12]\n\n","Rheem was the first residential HVAC company to begin using scroll compressors\nthroughout their lineup in 1994, and all air conditioners and heat pumps continue to use Copeland Scroll Compressors\n.[8]\n\n[13]\n\nThe company was also first to introduce a 14 SEER\nremote condensing unit in 1997. In 1998, the company began supplying the Home Depot\nwith a line of GE\nbranded water heaters.[14]\n\nIn 2009, Rheem and Ruud were the first to sell a Hybrid Heat Pump Water Heater, which was more than twice as efficient as similar electric water heaters.[15]\n\nAlso in the same year, Rheem and Ruud central air conditioners were reported to have the fewest percentage of units requiring repair among all major HVAC brands according to Consumer Reports\n\n.[16]\n\n","Rheem's market share of the central air conditioner\nmarket had ranged had been as high as 16% in the 1980s and had dropped to about 11% by 2000.[17]\n\nBy 2008, a report by the United States Department of Energy\nranked the firm as fifth in the U.S. in the central air conditioner and heat pump\nmarket with a 12% market share (behind UTC/Carrier\nwith 27%, both Goodman\n/Amana and American Standard/Trane\nwith 14% and Lennox\nwith 12%), while in the residential gas furnace market as of 2008, the company was also ranked fifth with a 12% market share (behind Carrier with 32%, Goodman with 15%, and both Lennox and Trane with 13%).[18]\n\n","Ruud was founded by Edwin Ruud\n(1854–1932), a Norwegian\nimmigrant who lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n. He developed the first automatic storage tank gas-fired water heater, which went into production in 1889.[19]\n\nRuud worked for George Westinghouse\n(1846–1914), but eventually bought the rights to produce the product he invented and formed his own company in 1897. In 1913, Ruud merged and absorbed the Humphrey Company of Kalamazoo, Michigan\nwhich also manufactured water heaters.[20]\n\nThe Humphrey Company had a large manufacturing operation in Kalamazoo, which Ruud continued to operate and expand. In 1954, Ruud moved all operations from Pittsburgh to Kalamazoo where they were headquartered until the purchase by Rheem in 1960.[21]\n\n","In North America, Rheem and Ruud both manufacture and sell a full line of heating and cooling products for residential and commercial applications, including up to 98.7% annual fuel use efficiency\ngas furnaces, oil fired furnaces, up to 20 SEER air conditioners, heat pumps, thermostats\n, air handlers\n, package units, and indoor air quality\nproducts such as media filters, UV lamps\n, and humidifiers\n. In many additional countries around the world, the companies sell numerous types of water heating equipment, including gas fired tank storage and tankless water heaters, high-efficiency condensing water heaters, hybrid heat pump water heaters, and solar water heaters under the Rheem, Ruud, Richmond, Paloma, Solahart, Splendid, and GE\nbrands. Swimming pool-related products include gas fired and heat pump heaters sold under the Rheem and Raypak brands. Protech replacement parts for HVAC systems are sold through the PROSTOCK retail program.[22]\n\n[9]\n\n","In December 2013, Rheem acquired Scottsboro, Alabama\n-based Heat Transfer Products Group (HTPG).[22]\n\nHTPG, a standalone company, produces the Russell, Witt, ColdZone and Kramer commercial refrigeration\nbrands.[9]\n\n","In 2015, Rheem won the top spot in the Water Heaters category for its brand familiarity by the Builder magazine.[23]\n\n","Rheem Califone manufactured A/V equipment under the Rheem, Califone, and Roberts brands commonly used in schools and institutions, including oublic address systems\n, reel-to-reel audio tape recorders\n, phonographs\n, as well as Combo organs\n.[24]\n\n[25]\n\n[26]\n\nRheem and Ruud also sold re-branded Briggs \u0026amp; Stratton\nresidential Emergency power systems\nbeginning in 2007.[27]\n\nHowever, as of March 2, 2013, the companies no longer listed backup generators on their respective Web sites.[28]\n\n","All currently operating facilities are ISO 9001\ncertified.[29]\n\n","Since 2007,[42]\n\nRheem has sponsored Richard Childress Racing\n(RCR) in the NASCAR\nSprint Cup Series\nand Xfinity Series\nthrough their Rheem, RUUD, and Richmond Water Heaters brands.[42]\n\n[43]\n\nThey previously sponsored Kevin Harvick\nand Harvick's racing team Kevin Harvick Incorporated\n(KHI), along with Ron Hornaday, Jr.\n, Cale Gale\nand other former RCR \u0026amp; KHI drivers in the Cup, Xfinity, and Camping World Truck Series\n.[43]\n\n[44]\n\n[45]\n\n[46]\n\nThey formerly sponsored James Buescher\nin the Xfinity Series and Truck Series.[43]\n\n[47]\n\nBrandon Jones\n, the son of current Rheem CEO J.R.

Scientific Atlanta was founded in 1951 by a group of engineers from the Georgia Institute of Technology\n, and was purchased by Cisco Systems\nin 2005 for $6.9 billion after Cisco received anti-trust clearance for the purchase.[1]\n\n[2]\n\nThe Cisco acquisition of Scientific Atlanta was ranked in the top 10 of largest technology acquisitions in history and was Cisco's largest acquisition to date.[3]\n\n[4]\n\nPrior to the purchase, Scientific Atlanta had been a Fortune 500 company and was one of the top 25 largest corporations in Georgia.[5]\n\n[6]\n\n[7]\n\n","Scientific Atlanta was considered by many to be \"the patriarch of Atlanta's technology industry for nearly six decades\" and is sometimes referred to as \"Atlanta's Microsoft or Hewlett Packard\".[8]\n\nIt was considered \"core to the development of technology in the Atlanta region\" and \"was to Atlanta what Hewlett-Packard was to Silicon Valley\" because of its legacy of spawning more than 35 substantial companies in the area.","","","Scientific Atlanta is a supplier of transmission networks for broadband access to the home, set-top cable boxes, cable modems and digital interactive subscriber systems for video, high-speed Internet, voice over IP (VoIP) networks, and worldwide customer service and support.","Products for the cable TV industry, from fiber optic\nnetwork equipment for head-end media acquisition, to Explorer\ndigital\ncable boxes\n(as well as universal remotes\nto go with them), and cable modems\n(formerly branded as WebSTAR\nuntil the Cisco acquisition in 2006), dominate Scientific Atlanta's sales. Scientific Atlanta's most popular modem is the Scientific Atlanta 2100, because it is often supplied by cable providers like Comcast\n, Time Warner Cable\nand Cox Communications\n. Scientific Atlanta also supplies distribution technology to networks such as Bloomberg Television\n, CNN\n, ESPN\nand many others.","In addition to providing products for traditional coaxial and fiber service operators, Scientific Atlanta also expanded its IPTV\nsolutions offerings after the merger with Cisco.[9]\n\nBefore this, on August 18, 2005, Scientific-Atlanta and SBC\n(now AT\u0026amp;T) signed a deal for Scientific-Atlanta to be the exclusive set-top provider for SBC U-verse\nTV.","Founded in October 1951[10]\n\nby six Georgia Tech Research Institute\nresearchers: James E. Boyd\n(future station director), Charles Griffin, Robert E. Honer (MSEE), Gerald Rosselot\n(station director), Lamar Whittle and Vernon Widerquist who each invested $100. In late 1952 Glen P. Robinson\nbecame the seventh member.[11]\n\nScientific Atlanta was started to produce technology developed at the research station.[12]\n\n[13]\n\n[14]\n\nAfter the fledgling company's first contract resulted in a $4,000 loss, Robinson bought out all but one of the original investors, and paid them each back their original $100.[14]\n\n","Glen P. Robinson\nserved as CEO of Scientific Atlanta for 20 years, and chairman of the board for an additional eight years, until he retired from the company in 1979. Scientific Atlanta grew dramatically; it earned $3.1 million in revenue in 1962 and approximately $200 million when Robinson left. Sidney Topol\nserved as its president from 1971–83, CEO from 1975–87, and chairman of the board from 1978-90. During his tenure, the company grew in sales to more than $600 million. During the 1970s the company developed the concept of cable/satellite connection, which, in working with HBO\nand transportable earth stations developed by TelePrompTer Corporation\nand manufactured by Scientific Atlanta, established satellite-delivered television for the cable industry.[15]\n\n","During the 1960s Scientific-Atlanta earned a place in the space and defense industries as a manufacturer of electronic testing equipment for antennae. By the end of that decade the company had added instruments for testing telephones and acoustic devices with defense applications. As a military contractor, the company distinguished itself by manufacturing unique electronic instruments for the federal government. According to Business Week\n, Scientific-Atlanta was a company \"fascinated with communications esoterica.\"","Scientific-Atlanta applied its energy to opportunities in new fields with large growth potential and few barriers to entry. The company sought out products that were either low-cost and high volume or had a very high price tag. \"You've either got to make 10,000 of something worth $100 to $200, or several of something worth $500,000 or $10 million,\" Topol told the New York Times\n. The company planned to make the low-cost, high volume end of this equation profitable through aggressive research and development and a strong marketing effort. In its annual report, as reprinted in David C. Rickert's Harvard Business School case study of Scientific-Atlanta, the company stated: \"Scientific-Atlanta operates under a disciplined business plan that concentrates on design, manufacture, and sale of standard technical products for the communications and instrumentation markets.\" More specifically, Topol recounted in Dun's Review, as restated by Rickert, \"I asked what products we needed for growing markets, not what markets we should go after because we had a product.\"","The answer to that question was telecommunications products, primarily the satellite earth station, a large mobile dish used to receive signals transmitted from communications satellites orbiting the earth. In 1973 the company displayed a portable satellite earth station at a communications trade show in California. It planned to sell the portable stations to companies in the relatively new and rapidly growing cable television field so they could transmit their programming to a large number of stations in different areas. The stations, in turn, would send the programming to consumers' homes over their cable networks. At the time, however, observers told Scientific-Atlanta executives that satellite transmission of cable television programming would take place only in the distant future.","These predictions proved incorrect and as the cable television industry boomed in the mid- to late 1970s, Scientific-Atlanta grew with it. The company's profits ballooned by 40 percent a year from 1972 on as Scientific-Atlanta came to dominate the market it had largely pioneered. In 1976, as sales rose to more than $45 million, the company greatly expanded its manufacturing, laboratory, and office space at its headquarters. It sold two-thirds of the 3,000 satellite earth stations purchased by cable companies during the 1970s, enabling its clients—broadcasters such as Home Box Office (HBO) and Showtime/The Movie Channel—to become pillars of the cable broadcasting industry. Scientific-Atlanta's strength in satellite earth stations helped to enhance its overall sales of cable television equipment, and the company also began to market other components necessary to operate a cable television system.","In addition to its satellite products for the cable industry, Scientific-Atlanta manufactured testing and measuring devices for telecommunications, industrial, and laboratory use. The company added to its instrumentation operations when it acquired the San Diego-based Spectral Dynamics Corporation, a manufacturer of scientific devices, in 1978 for $17.4 million. Spectral Dynamics brought with it European sales subsidiaries in Germany, France, England, and the Netherlands. With these additions, Scientific-Atlanta had sales network that covered 40 countries and was supported by a worldwide service network that adjusted and repaired its instruments. Both Scientific-Atlanta and Spectral Dynamics relied on continual research and development to bring new products to market, thereby enhancing market share and fostering company growth.","By the start of 1979 Scientific-Atlanta employed 2,700 people. That year the company also introduced Homesat, a subsidiary formed to market satellite equipment to homeowners who lived in areas too remote to receive adequate television reception.","In addition to its two main areas of operation—communications and instrumentation—Scientific-Atlanta entered the field of home security and energy management during the 1970s. The company marketed wireless home alarm systems and provided equipment to utilities that enabled them to monitor home energy use.","By the dawn of the 1980s, Scientific Atlanta had become the world's largest supplier of satellite earth stations.","In February 2003, Scientific-Atlanta introduced their first Explorer HD set-top box, which is capable of displaying HDTV\nprogramming, at Best Buy\nstores in the Phoenix metropolitan area\n. It was later rolled out nationwide. In March 2004, Scientific-Atlanta launched the Explorer 8000HD, their first set-top box with both DVR and HD.","In the set-top arena, Scientific-Atlanta once enjoyed 100% market share with Time Warner Cable\n, Cablevision\nand AT\u0026amp;T U-verse\n; all three companies have since started to transition to other boxes, Cablevision using Samsung\n, while TWC and U-verse are split between SA/Cisco and competitor Arris\n(formerly Motorola). Comcast\nalso has a split account with the two companies. Other companies that have split accounts with SA and Arris are Suddenlink Communications\n, Charter Communications\nand Cox\n; the two vendors also had split accounts for Adelphia\nbefore that company went under in 2006. Pace plc\n, who mainly competes in foreign markets, serves as a domestic rival, but on a limited scale.","On November 18, 2005, Scientific Atlanta announced that it would be purchased by Cisco Systems\nin a US$6.9 billion cash deal. On February 25, 2006, Cisco Systems announced that it had completed acquisition of Scientific Atlanta in a cash deal that paid $43 per share. The total cash value of the deal was roughly US$7 billion, or US$5.1 billion net of Scientific Atlanta's cash balance, and also about US$5.1 billion over their 2005 href=\"/wiki/Shareholders%27_equity\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shareholders' equity\"\u003eshareholders' equity\n.

This makes Lawrenceville the second oldest city in the metropolitan Atlanta area. The city is named after Commodore James Lawrence\n, commander of the frigate Chesapeake\n\nduring the War of 1812\n. Lawrence, a native of New Jersey\n, is probably best known today for his dying command, \"Don't give up the ship!\" William Maltbie, the town's first postmaster, suggested the name of \"Lawrenceville\".","In 1821, a permanent site for the county courthouse was selected and purchased, the four streets bordering the square were laid out along with other streets in the village, and a public well was dug. Major Grace built the first permanent courthouse, a brick structure, in 1823-24 for a cost of $4,000. The courthouse presently on the square was constructed in 1885.","Courtland Winn\nserved two terms as mayor starting in 1884 when he was 21 years old.","The two most famous people born in Lawrenceville gained their fame elsewhere. Charles Henry Smith\n, born in 1826, left as a young man and lived most of his life in other Georgia towns. During the Civil War\nhe wrote humorous pieces for Atlanta newspapers under the name Bill Arp. He has been described as the South's most popular writer of the late 19th century, though he is not much read today. Ezzard Charles\n, born in 1921, grew up in Cincinnati\n, where opportunities for African-Americans were far better at the time than in the Deep South. He eventually became the World Heavyweight boxing champion by defeating Joe Louis\nby unanimous decision on September 27, 1950.","Another resident, Oliver Hardy\n, became a world-renowned comic actor, a member of the film duo Laurel and Hardy from the 1920s to the 1940s. He lived as a child in downtown Lawrenceville around 1900. But his stay was brief, because his family moved often within Georgia.","Lawrenceville was one of many venues in the nation where Hustler\n\nmagazine publisher Larry Flynt\nfaced obscenity charges in the late 1970s. On March 6, 1978, during a lunch break in his Lawrenceville trial, he and his local attorney Gene Reeves were shot by a sniper near the courthouse. Both survived, though Flynt was seriously disabled. Years later, imprisoned serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin\nclaimed to have been the shooter, but he never produced any proof and was not charged in the case. (Franklin was executed in 2013 in Missouri for a 1977 sniper slaying.)

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94def00262df3aa1b2f566"},"content":{"contents":["The Simmons Bedding Company\nis an American major manufacturer of mattresses\nand related bedding products, based in Atlanta, Georgia\n. The company was founded in 1870, and is one of the oldest companies of its kind in the United States. Simmons' flagship brand is Beautyrest\n. In addition to operating 18 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Puerto Rico, the company licenses its products internationally. According to a Simmons press release\n, net sales\nfor 2005 were $855 million, and its revenue was $1.13 billion in 2007 and $1.228 billion in 2013.[1]\n\nAs of 2011, Simmons ranked in third place among U.S. mattress manufacturers, with a 15.7 percent market share.[2]\n\nIn 2012, Simmons and its sister company Serta International\nwere acquired by American private equity\ncompany Advent International\n.[3]\n\n","","","In 1870, Zalmon G. Simmons\nopened his first factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin\n. He started out by manufacturing wooden telegraph\ninsulators\nand cheese boxes.[4]\n\nHe branched into making bedsprings after receiving a patent\nfor a woven-wire bedspring in payment of a debt.[5]\n\nIn 1876, Simmons became the first manufacturer to mass-produce woven wire mattresses. This process helped the company produce beds faster and cheaper, and by 1889, with the introduction of spiral coil springs\ninto woven mattresses, Simmons’ mattress prices dropped from $12 to 95 cents, making mattresses more widely affordable.[6]\n\nThe business was incorporated in 1884 as the Northwestern Wire Mattress Company, adopting Simmons Manufacturing Company as its name in 1889. According to company records, by 1891 it was the largest company \"of its kind in the world\".[5]\n\n","Zalmon Simmons, Jr., who took charge of the business after his father's death in 1910, was to oversee additional growth.[5]\n\nIn 1916 Simmons began advertising nationally, initiating its first national advertising campaign with a double-spread ad in the Saturday Evening Post\n\n.[4]\n\n","By 1919 growth was fast. In response, Simmons acquired manufacturing plants in San Francisco, California\n; Los Angeles, California\n; Montreal\n, Quebec\n; Toronto\n, Ontario\n; Winnipeg\n, Manitoba\n; Vancouver\n, British Columbia\n; Elizabeth, New Jersey\n; Seattle, Washington\n; and Atlanta, Georgia.[4]\n\nThe following year, Simmons started a new sales arrangement. Instead of purchasing a mattress directly off the retail floor, customers could test the product on in-store samples, order a mattress through the retailer, and receive direct delivery within the next 24 hours from one of Simmons' 64 warehouses\n.[4]\n\n[5]\n\nThis arrangement reduced the need for retailers to own and store their own product inventories.[4]\n\nIn 1923, Simmons moved its corporate headquarters to New York City.[5]\n\n","Equipment developed by Simmons in 1925 automated the process of coiling wire and inserting it into fabric sleeves, called encasements. This allowed mass production of pocketed coils\n, a type of coil that had been available only in very high-priced luxury mattresses. The pocketed coil is the basis for the Simmons Beautyrest mattress brand, which was introduced in 1925.[4]\n\nAlthough the new manufacturing technology greatly reduced its cost, at the time of its introduction a Beautyrest mattress sold for $39.50, three to four times more than the typical price for a standard wire mattress.[5]\n\nSimmons promoted its products aggressively with ads that included testimonials from famous people such as Eleanor Roosevelt\nin 1927 and Henry Ford\n, H.G. Wells\n, Thomas Edison\n, Guglielmo Marconi\nand George Bernard Shaw\nin 1929. Eleanor Roosevelt continued to promote the brand into the 1930s, through her radio show.[4]\n\nCole Porter\nmentioned the Beautyrest brand in the lyrics of his 1934 song \"Anything Goes\n\".[7]\n\n","In 1940, Simmons introduced the Hide-A-Bed\n, a sofa\nthat incorporates a fold-out spring and mattress that pull out to form a bed. This was to become one of the company’s best known products and was manufactured until the 1980s.[5]\n\nDuring World War II\n, Simmons' facilities were diverted to military production, making cots\n, parachutes\n, bazooka\nrockets and other products.[4]\n\n[5]\n\nBy the post-war year of 1947, the company was back in the mattress business and started using advertising to associate its products with the Hollywood glamor of actresses including Dorothy Lamour\nand ureen O'Hara\n.[4]\n\nA research and development facility was established in Munster, Indiana\n, in 1957, building upon pioneering studies on human sleep behavior that Simmons had sponsored in the 1930s. In 1958, the company became the first U.S. mattress maker to produce mattresses in king and queen sizes,[4]\n\nan innovation that was promoted as solving the \"space battle in the bedroom\".[6]\n\n","In 1975, the Simmons corporate headquarters moved to Atlanta, Georgia. Shortly thereafter, the company research and development\nteam also relocated to Georgia, to a building in what is today Peachtree Corners\nbut was then an unincorporated part of Gwinnett County\n, near Norcross\n.[4]\n\nIn 1995, the company’s R\u0026amp;D division moved into a new home, the Simmons Institute for Technology and Education (SITE).[4]\n\n","Simmons underwent the first in a series of corporate mergers and acquisitions in 1979, when the company was acquired by Gulf+Western\n. Six years later, Gulf+Western sold Simmons to Wickes Corporation\n.[5]\n\nWesray Capital\nbought the business in 1986, and sold it to the Simmons employee stock ownership plan\nin 1989.[7]\n\nMerrill Lynch Capital Partners\nobtained a majority interest in Simmons in 1991,[5]\n\n[7]\n\nand sold to Investcorp\nin about 1996. Fenway Partners\nbought the company about two years later, then sold to Thomas H. Lee Partners\nin 2003.[7]\n\n","In the 1990s a commercial for the Simmons Beautyrest featured a bowling ball\nbeing dropped on a Beautyrest mattress and a standard open-coil mattress to illustrate the company's claim that a person’s nighttime movements are less likely to disturb a sleep partner if their mattress is a Beautyrest.[4]\n\n[8]\n\nThe bowling ball demonstration, which was popular with Simmons dealers, consumers, and industry experts, was revived in 2006.[8]\n\n","In 2003, Fenway Partners made the Sleep Country USA chain of retail stores a part of Simmons;[9]\n\nin 2006 Simmons sold the chain to The Sleep Train\nof Citrus Heights, California\n.[10]\n\nThe following year, the company added memory foam\nproducts to its offerings by acquiring the Comfor–Pedic line of memory foam mattresses and pillows\nfrom Comfor Products of Kent, Washington\n.[11]\n\n","The company suffered financially under the successive ownership of multiple private equity firms and other private investors. The private equity owners extracted $750 million in profits out of Simmons, while the company's debt increased from $164 million in 1991 to $1.3 billion in 2009.[7]\n\nOn September 25, 2009, Simmons announced a Chapter 11\nrestructuring plan and signed a purchase agreement with an investor group led by Ares Management\nand on_Plan\" title=\"Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan\"\u003eOntario Teachers' Pension Plan\n.[12]\n\nThe bankruptcy court approved the deal, reducing the company's total debt from about $1 billion to $450 million. The bankruptcy did not include subsidiaries in Canada and Puerto Rico, but those units were included in the deal with Ares Management and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.[13]\n\nAres and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan were also the owners of the Serta brand name under National Bedding Company LLC. They operated Serta and Simmons Bedding as independent entities that continued to compete with one another.[14]\n\n","On October 2, 2012, private equity firm Advent International acquired a majority interest in AOT Bedding Super Holdings (now Serta Simmons Holdings, LLC), the parent company of Simmons and Serta. Ares Management and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan continued to own a \"significant\" share of company equity.[3]\n\nAt the time of the Advent acquisition, Simmons and Serta together held a 34 percent share of the U.S. mattress market.[2]\n\nSimmons and Serta retained separate sales, marketing, research and development, and merchandising departments, and continue to remain separate.[3]\n\n"],"title":"Simmons Bedding Company","rels":["/wiki/Sleep_Country_Canada#Bloom","/wiki/Casper_Sleep","/wiki/Dorel_Industries","/wiki/Endy_Sleep","/wiki/Eve_Sleep","/wiki/Helix_Sleep","/wiki/IKEA","/wiki/Leggett_%26_Platt","/wiki/Purple_Innovation","/wiki/Saatva","/wiki/Sealy_Corporation","/wiki/Select_Comfort","/wiki/Serta_(company)","/wiki/Shifman_Mattress_Company","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Spring_Air_Company","/wiki/Tempur-Pedic","/wiki/Therm-a-Rest","/wiki/Tuft_%26_Needle","/wiki/AGCO","/wiki/Duluth,_Georgia","/wiki/American_Megatrends","/wiki/Gwinnett_County,_Georgia","/wiki/Sandy_Springs,_Georgia","/wiki/AT%26T_Mobility","/wiki/Atlanta_Bread_Company","/wiki/Smyrna,_Georgia","/wiki/Atlanta_Gas_Light","/wiki/BellSouth","/wiki/Chick-fil-A","/wiki/College_Park,_Georgia","/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company","/wiki/Cox_Enterprises","/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines","/wiki/EarthLink","/wiki/Equifax","/wiki/ExpressJet","/wiki/Georgia_Natural_Gas","/wiki/Georgia-Pacific","/wiki/Georgia_Power","/wiki/Holiday_Inn","/wiki/Holiday_Inn_Express","/wiki/The_Home_Depot","/wiki/Cobb_County,_Georgia","/wiki/Hooters","/wiki/Intercontinental_Exchange","/wiki/Krystal_(restaurant)","/wiki/Kool_Smiles","/wiki/Marietta,_Georgia","/wiki/Merial","/wiki/NCR_Corporation","/wiki/Popeyes","/wiki/RaceTrac","/wiki/Rheem","/wiki/Scientific_Atlanta","/wiki/Lawrenceville,_Georgia","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Southern_Company","/wiki/SunTrust_Banks","/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System","/wiki/United_Parcel_Service","/wiki/Waffle_House","/wiki/The_Weather_Channel_(United_States)","/wiki/Simmons_Bedding_Company","/wiki/Simmons_Bedding_Company"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Simmons_Bedding_Company"}

Southern Power serves wholesale electricity customers across the U.S. Southern Company Gas serves utility customers in seven states.","Southern Company owns the following companies:","Southern Company can be traced back to 1924, when Southeastern Power \u0026amp; Light was formed as a holding company for Alabama Traction, Light and Power (formed 1906), the immediate forerunner of Alabama Power. Later that year, it formed Mississippi Power as a subsidiary, with Gulf Power following in 1925. In 1926, it merged with Georgia Power (formed 1902). In 1930, Southeastern Power \u0026amp; Light merged into the Commonwealth \u0026amp; Southern Corporation. The new system included five Northern companies and six Southern companies. However, in the late 1940s Commonwealth \u0026amp; Southern was dissolved to meet the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935\n. Four of Commonwealth \u0026amp; Southern's Deep South operating companies—Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power—were deemed to be an integrated system and thus were allowed to remain under common ownership. A new holding company, Southern Company, was incorporated in Delaware on November 9, 1945. It commenced operation in 1949, and moved to Georgia in 1950. In 1954–55, the company was involved in the Dixon-Yates contract\nwith the Atomic Energy Commission\n, and the associated political controversy.[4]\n\n","In 1981, Southern Company became the first electric utility holding company in 46 years to diversify its operations by forming an unregulated subsidiary. In January 1982, Southern Energy, Inc., began official operations as a global energy company, growing to serve 10 countries on four continents. On April 2, 2001, Southern Company completed the spinoff of Southern Energy as Mirant Corporation\n.","Another Southern Company subsidiary—Southern Nuclear—began providing services in 1991 to the system's nuclear power plants.","In 1996, Southern Communications Services began providing digital wireless communications services to Southern Company's subsidiaries and also began marketing these services to the public within the Southeast as Southern Linc. Southern Telecom, a telecommunications subsidiary of Southern Company, was founded in 1997. Southern Telecom provides colocation\nand dark fiber\noptic lines to network businesses.[5]\n\n","On January 9, 2001, Southern Company received final approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to form Southern Power, a subsidiary to own, manage and finance wholesale generating assets in the Southeast. The new subsidiary targets wholesale customers.","On July 19, 2002, Southern Company Gas received certification from the Georgia Public Service Commission to enter the retail gas market. After nearly four years of operations, the company was sold and customers transferred to Cobb EMC's newly formed affiliate, Gas South.","In 2016, Southern Company acquired PowerSecure, a distributed energy infrastructure technologies company, and AGL Resources (which was renamed Southern Company Gas\n). As a result of the AGL Resources merger, Southern Company doubled its customer base, expanded its footprint and broadened the scope of its business by increasing its natural gas presence.[6]\n\n","Southern Company subsidiaries operate hydroelectric, gas, coal, and nuclear generation sources to generate approximately 200 terawatt-hours of electricity. In 2009, coal represented 57 percent of the company's output, followed by nuclear\n(23%) and natural gas\n(16%). Renewable hydroelectric power\nrepresented 4 percent of Southern's generation. Coal-based generation dropped significantly in 2009 from an average of 70% between 2005 and 2008.[7]\n\n","In June 2010, the United States Department of Energy\nawarded an $8.3 billion loan guarantee\nto facilitate the construction of two new nuclear reactors\nat Plant Vogtle\n, near Augusta, Georgia\n. A Southern Company subsidiary, Georgia Power, owns 45.7% of the current 2,430 MW facility, with co-owners Oglethorpe Power\n(30%) Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia\n(22.7%) and the City of Dalton\n(1.6%). The plant is operated by Georgia Power. The $14 billion construction project is scheduled to be completed by 2016 and would double the plant's capacity.[8]\n\n","The construction of two 1,154 MW reactors has been hailed by Energy Secretary Steven Chu\nas \"the first new nuclear power plant to break ground in decades\". It is expected to create up to 3,500 jobs during the construction phase, and 800 once operational.[9]\n\nHowever in March 2017 Westinghouse Electric Company\n, who are building the plant, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\nbecause of $9 billion of losses from its two U.S. nuclear construction projects.[10]\n\nThe U.S. government had given $8.3 billion of loan guarantees on the financing of the four nuclear reactors being built in the U.S., and it is expected a way forward to completing the plant can be agreed.[11]\n\n","In September 2013 the EPA\nintroduced new provisions regarding output of carbon emissions in new power facilities. The proposed emission limit for new energy sources will be 1,100lbs of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour of electricity.[12]\n\nPreemptively recognizing the need for these changes, Southern Company broke ground on its 21st-century clean coal facility in June 2010.[13]\n\nSouthern’s subsidiary, Mississippi Power\nwill operate the plant. The Kemper County Energy Facility, or Kemper Project\n, takes advantage of the abundant lignite\n, or poor quality coal, available in Mississippi.[14]\n\nAdditionally, it employs Transport Gasifier (TRIG) technology. TRIG technology is built on the idea of dry-feed, non-slag gasifiers, which operate at lower temperatures than other coal gasifiers. This dry-feed is crushed, heated, and circulated in the gasifier, producing a flammable synthetic gas, syngas. Syngas can generate electricity with fewer emissions. Of course, other byproducts are produced, like ammonia and sulphuric acid. These particular products are sold for commercial use.[15]\n\n","The EPA\nconsiders the Kemper Coal Project\nand other planned facilities like it, to be a lifeline for the coal industry in the wake of the new climate change plan. Between 2010 and 2014, approximately 150 coal plants were shut down.[16]\n\n","As of April 2014, the US Department of Energy\nhad invested $270m in this project. Southern Company, and its subsidiary, Mississippi Power\nanticipate that the Kemper Coal Plant will generate enough energy to serve more than 187,000 customers. Upon opening, the Kemper Coal Project is expected to be capable of stripping out at least 65% of the carbon dioxide, significantly exceeding the EPA’s proposed requirement of 40%.[17]\n\n","Southern Company works closely with the US Department of Energy\non a variety of projects including transmission and distribution of infrastructure and smart grid initiatives, environmental research programs, and nuclear generation. One of the more significant joint efforts, the DOE’s National Carbon Capture Center, is managed by Southern Company and represents national efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\nfrom coal-based power generation. At this location, Southern Company has been working with scientists and technology developers from government, industry, and universities who are creating the next generation of carbon capture technologies.[18]\n\n","Along with the DOE, Southern Company has been working with KBR\n, another technology partner, to perfect its TRIG advanced coal gasification\ntechnology.[19]\n\nThis process of breaking down “dirty coal”, or lignite\n, into its chemical components is not only cleaner, but it’s also less expensive and more reliable.[20]\n\nThis technology is currently being implemented at Southern Company’s Kemper County power plant, one of the few new coal facilities working to keep the US coal industry alive. This new facility will be built on a lignite seam, is expected to strip out two-thirds of carbon dioxide emissions, leaving emissions at about the same level as natural gas. The Kemper Coal Plant is expected to fall well under new regulations implemented by the EPA, which limits coal plants to 1,100lbs of carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt hour of electricity.[16]\n\n","In an effort to make this technology more attainable, Southern Company has partnered with China’s Shenhua Group to collaborate on further research, development, and deployment of clean coal technologies in the US, China, and around the world.[21]\n\nThis partnership with Shenhua, who is currently expected to add more than 400,000 megawatts of coal-fired capacity by 2035, could lead to wide deployment of TRIG-equipped power plants across Asia. TRIG technology has the potential to not only assist China with their growing carbon issue, but also enable the country to tap into their own low quality coal.[22]\n\n","In February 2015, the Mississippi Supreme Court\nruled Southern Company's subsidiary Mississippi Power\nmust refund 186,000 South Mississippi ratepayers for rate increases related to the Kemper Project\n.[23]\n\nThese fees are derived from Mississippi's Baseload Act, allowing Mississippi Power to charge ratepayers for powerplants under construction.","In May 2016, Southern Company and its subsidiary Mississippi Power announced they were being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission\nrelated to overruns at the Kemper Project.[24]\n\nThe project had been repeatedly delayed and costs increased from $2.88 billion to $6.58 billion.[25]\n\n","In June 2016, Mississippi Power was sued by Treetop Midstream Services over cancelation of a contract to receive carbon dioxide\nfrom the Kemper Project as part of the carbon capture and storage\ndesign.[26]\n\nTreetop had contracted to buy carbon dioxide from the Kemper plant and had built a pipeline in preparation to receive the gas. Treetop alleged Mississippi Power had fraudulently and \"intentionally misrepresenting and concealing the start date\" for the Kemper Project, though Mississippi Power stated the suit was without merit.","The company was also found to have unlawfully fired a whistle-blower\nwho had criticized alleged false statements by company management.[27]\n\n","As a coal-burning energy company, greenhouse gas\nemissions are a primary environmental concern. According to a 2007 study[28]\n\nconducted by the Center for Global Development, the Southern Company is the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the U.S. utility industry, with an annual tally of 172 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent\ngases.","In response to growing public and financial community interest the company has enacted both corrective and palliative environmental measures.","The company recently opened the Plant Crist Test Center[29]\n\nin Pensacola, Florida\n, where they hope to discover new ways to reduce mercury emissions.[30]\n\n","Additionally, the company has developed TRIG advanced coal gasification\ntechnology which turns coal into gas that can be used to generate electricity with less emissions than traditional coal-fired power plants. Southern Company’s Kemper Project\nin Mississippi will be the only Integrated gasification combined cycle\n(IGCC) plant in the U.S. that will capture and store carbon dioxide\nemissions from commercial operations starting in 2014.[31]\n\n","Southern Company is building one of the largest all-biomass plants in the nation.[32]\n\nThe company expects the 100-megawatt Nacogdoches Generating Facility to serve the city of Austin for 20 years.","In partnership with Turner Renewable Energy, the company is building one of the largest solar photovoltaic plants in the U.S. near Cimarron, New Mexico\n.[33]\n\nThe 30-megawatt project will supply power to approximately 9,000 homes.","The company manages and operates the National Carbon Capture Center, a focal point of U.S. Department of Energy\n's efforts to develop carbon capture\nand greenhouse gas reduction technologies,[34]\n\nunder which various projects to test geologic sequestration\nare in progress at Plant Gorgas in Alabama, Plant Daniel in Mississippi and other company sites.","Southern Company participates in Renew Our Rivers\n, a volunteer program to remove debris from rivers and other waterways throughout the Southeast\n, which claims[35]\n\nover 11 million pounds of trash removed or recycled in Renew Our Rivers events.","Coal-burning (whether direct or via gasification) energy production continues to be an environmental concern, and Southern Company continues to produce large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions as part of its day-to-day operations.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","\n"],"title":"Southern Company","rels":["/wiki/Thomas_A._Fanning","/wiki/Chairman#Public_corporations","/wiki/President_(corporate_title)","/wiki/CEO","/wiki/Vice_president#In_business","/wiki/CFO","/wiki/Alabama_Power","/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama","/wiki/Georgia_Power","/wiki/Gulf_Power","/wiki/Pensacola,_Florida","/wiki/Florida_Panhandle","/wiki/Mississippi_Power","/wiki/Gulfport,_Mississippi","/wiki/Southern_Company_Services","/wiki/Southern_Linc","/wiki/Southern_Nuclear","/wiki/Joseph_M._Farley_Nuclear_Generating_Station","/wiki/Edwin_I._Hatch_Nuclear_Generating_Station","/wiki/Vogtle_Electric_Generating_Plant","/wiki/Nuclear_power_plants","/wiki/Fossil_fuels","/wiki/Southern_Telecom_(Southern_Company)","/wiki/Southern_Company_Gas","/wiki/Jacob_Horton","/wiki/List_of_United_States_electric_companies","/wiki/Electric_utility","/wiki/AGCO","/wiki/Duluth,_Georgia","/wiki/American_Megatrends","/wiki/Gwinnett_County,_Georgia","/wiki/Sandy_Springs,_Georgia","/wiki/AT%26T_Mobility","/wiki/Atlanta_Bread_Company","/wiki/Smyrna,_Georgia","/wiki/Atlanta_Gas_Light","/wiki/BellSouth","/wiki/Chick-fil-A","/wiki/College_Park,_Georgia","/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company","/wiki/Cox_Enterprises","/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines","/wiki/EarthLink","/wiki/Equifax","/wiki/ExpressJet","/wiki/Georgia_Natural_Gas","/wiki/Georgia-Pacific","/wiki/Georgia_Power","/wiki/Holiday_Inn","/wiki/Holiday_Inn_Express","/wiki/The_Home_Depot","/wiki/Cobb_County,_Georgia","/wiki/Hooters","/wiki/Intercontinental_Exchange","/wiki/Krystal_(restaurant)","/wiki/Kool_Smiles","/wiki/Marietta,_Georgia","/wiki/Merial","/wiki/NCR_Corporation","/wiki/Popeyes","/wiki/RaceTrac","/wiki/Rheem","/wiki/Scientific_Atlanta","/wiki/Lawrenceville,_Georgia","/wiki/Simmons_Bedding_Company","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/SunTrust_Banks","/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System","/wiki/United_Parcel_Service","/wiki/Waffle_House","/wiki/The_Weather_Channel_(United_States)","/wiki/AES_Corporation","/wiki/American_Electric_Power","/wiki/American_Water_(company)","/wiki/CenterPoint_Energy","/wiki/Consolidated_Edison","/wiki/Dominion_Energy","/wiki/Duke_Energy","/wiki/Edison_International","/wiki/Exelon","/wiki/FirstEnergy","/wiki/NextEra_Energy","/wiki/NiSource","/wiki/Pacific_Gas_and_Electric_Company","/wiki/Public_Service_Enterprise_Group","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Southern_Company","/wiki/Southern_Company"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Southern_Company"}

It rolled up 81-year-old Hillsboro Bank, based in Plant City\n, an institution with $150 million in assets and then the third-oldest state-chartered bank. It also bought Florida State Bank of Tallahassee, which had tried to merge with Sun in 1973, but the deal fell apart when the economy soured.[12]\n\n","Then, in May 1983, Sun announced a deal for Miami-based Flagship Bank Inc., with $3.3 billion in assets, that catapulted Sun to be one of the Florida's largest bank holding companies. The Flagship deal was the seventh struck by Sun in less than a year.[12]\n\n","In 1985, Trust Company of Georgia and SunBanks merged to form SunTrust Banks, Inc. The merged company operated as Trust Company Bank in Georgia and Sun Bank in Florida until 1995, when all banks took the SunTrust name.","In 1986, shortly after the Trust Company–SunBanks merger, SunTrust purchased Third National Corporation of Nashville\n, though it continued to use the Third National name in Tennessee until merging its entire banking network under the SunTrust name in 1995.","SunTrust purchased Crestar Financial Corporation\nof Richmond, Virginia\nin 1998 expanding the company’s footprint into Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia.

In 1919, Ernest Woodruff\n, president of the Trust Company from 1904 to 1922, and W. C. Bradley\nbought The Coca-Cola Company for $25 million and restructured. The Trust Company of Georgia helped underwrite the initial public offering, accepting shares of Coke in exchange for its services.[9]\n\nFour years later, his son, Robert W. Woodruff\n, was elected Coca-Cola's president, a title he would hold until 1954 and was a board member until 1984.","As a result, SunTrust owned 48.3 million shares (3.58%) of Coke as of 2006, which had a GAAP\ncost basis of $110,000. In addition, the original copy of the formula for Coca-Cola was stored in a safe deposit box\nof an eventual SunTrust location in Atlanta (originally a Trust Company Bank\nlocation) from 1925 to 2011.[27]\n\nIt was eventually moved to a purpose built vault in the World of Coca-Cola\n, also in Atlanta.[28]\n\n","Over the years, Coca-Cola executives would sit on SunTrust's board of directors\n[29]\n\nand SunTrust execs would sit on Coca-Cola's board.[30]\n\n","SunTrust started to divest Coke shares in May 2007, when it sold 4.5 million, or 9% of its position.[31]\n\nIn 2008, the bank sold another 10 million shares, donated 3.6 million to SunTrust's charitable foundation, and crafted a plan to sell more shares in 2014 and 2015.[32]\n\n","However, in September 2012, SunTrust sold all of its Coke shares at the behest of its primary regulator, the Federal Reserve.[33]\n\nSunTrust was forced to resubmit its capital plan – known as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)\n– after it failed part of the stress test in March 2012. The Coke shares (or any stock holding) held by SunTrust would weigh on the bank's capital ratio under new capital rules within Basel III\n. Thus, SunTrust decided to accelerate its plan and sold the Coke shares earlier than expected.[34]\n\n","In 2014, the Federal government together with state attorneys general in 49 states and the District of Columbia reached a settlement requiring SunTrust Mortgage, Inc., to provide $500 million in various forms of relief to mortgage borrowers. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered the Consent Order on September 30, 2014. The consent order addressed SunTrust's alleged misconduct regarding its mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices. SunTrust was also required to create a 40 million dollar fund for the approximately 45,000 SunTrust borrowers who were foreclosed upon between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2013. In addition, SunTrust was required to adhere to significant new homeowner protections. The consent order required that SunTrust follow the servicing standards set up by the 2012 National Mortgage Settlement (NMS) with the five largest banks.","In September 2015 SunTrust laid off one hundred IT professionals with a controversial severance agreement clause by SunTrust that required laid-off employees to be available to help without pay for a period of two years.

The deal was reported to be in the neighborhood of $200 million.[29]\n\nOn October 2015, Turner launched a streaming-video network named Great Big Story.[30]\n\n","In April 2017, in order to expedite the sale of Time Warner to AT\u0026amp;T\nby shedding FCC-licensed properties, WPCH-TV\nwas sold to Meredith Corporation\n. It had already been operating WPCH on its behalf since 2011 as a sister to its local station WGCL-TV\n.[31]\n\n","Latin America\n\nThe channels in Latin America are controlled by Turner Broadcasting System Latin America\n, headquartered in Atlanta. It broadcasts Latin American\nversions of U.S. channels, and also channels that are exclusive for the region. TBS LA also handles advertising sales for Warner TV\n(owned by fellow Time Warner division Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.\n) and for the Brazilian action sports channel Woohoo.","News and Information\n","Indian\n","Kids and Teens\n","Lifestyle\n","Music\n","Movies \u0026amp;

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94defd0262df3aa1b2f56a"},"content":{"contents":["United Parcel Service\n(UPS\n) is an American multinational\npackage delivery\ncompany and a provider of supply chain management\nsolutions.[4]\n\nThe global logistics company is headquartered in the U.S. city of Sandy Springs, Georgia\n, which is a part of the Greater Atlanta metropolitan area\n.","Along with the central package delivery operation, the UPS brand name (in a fashion to that of competitor FedEx\n) is used to denote many of its divisions and subsidiaries, including its cargo airline (UPS Airlines\n), freight-based trucking operation (UPS Freight\n, formerly Overnite Transportation), and retail-based packing and shipping centers (The UPS Store\n).","","","On August 28, 1907, James Casey\nfounded the American Messenger Company\nwith Claude Ryan[5]\n\nin Seattle, Washington\n,[6]\n\ncapitalized with $100 in debt.[7]\n\nMost deliveries at this time were made on foot and bicycles were used for longer trips.","The American Messenger Company focused primarily on package delivery to retail stores with special delivery mail delivered for its largest client the United States Postal Service\n. In 1913 the company acquired a Model T Ford\nas its first delivery vehicle. Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed Merchants Parcel Delivery\n. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle.[7]\n\nIn 1916 Charlie Soderstrom joined Merchants Parcel Delivery bringing in more vehicles for the growing delivery business. In 1919 the company expanded for the first time outside of Seattle to Oakland, California\nand changed its name to United Parcel Service\n. The name change to United Parcel Service was to remind the company expansion that operations were still United\nunder the same organisation and Parcel\nidentified the type of business offered as part of its Service\n. Common carrier\nservice was acquired in 1922 from a company in Los Angeles, California\n. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer common carrier service. At first common carrier was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924 a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling of packages for UPS operations.[8]\n\n","In 1930, a consolidated service began in New York City, and soon after in other major cities in the East\nand the Midwest\n.[3]\n\nThe use of common carrier for delivery between all customers placed UPS in direct competition with the United States Postal Service\nand the Interstate Commerce Commission\n. The common carrier service was applied in cities where UPS could use the service without the authority of the ICC and state commerce commissions. The first city for UPS to use common carrier status outside California was Chicago, Illinois\nin 1953.[9]\n\n","Air service through UPS was first used in 1929 through private airlines. However, The Great Depression\nand a lack of volume ended the air service. In 1953 UPS resumed air service called UPS Blue Label Air with two-day service to major cities along the East Coast and West Coast.[10]\n\n","In 1975, UPS moved its headquarters to Greenwich, Connecticut\nand began servicing all of the 48 contiguous states\nof the United States. The expanded operations to all 48 states made UPS the first package delivery company to serve every address in the Continental United States. UPS went international in 1975 establishing operations in Canada\nand in 1976 operations were established in Germany\n. On February 28, UPS Ltd. (later changed to UPS Canada Ltd.) began operations in Toronto, Ontario\n. UPS Canada's head office is located in Burlington, Ontario\n. In 1976, UPS established a domestic operation in West Germany\n.[11]\n\n","UPS Next Day Air Service was launched in 1985 for all 48 states plus Puerto Rico\n. In 1988, UPS Airlines was launched with authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration\n. UPS Airlines became the fastest-growing airline in FAA history and today is the 10th largest airline in the United States.[12]\n\nDomestic air service was added to Germany\nin 1989.[13]\n\nIn 1991, UPS moved its headquarters to Sandy Springs, Georgia\n, a suburb of Atlanta\n. In 1992, UPS acquired both Haulfast\nand Carryfast\nand rebranded them UPS Supply Chain Solutions. Haulfast provided the pallet haulage and trucking network for the CarryFast group of companies. By 1993 UPS was delivering up to 11.5 million packages and documents per day.","The large volume of UPS customers in the 1990s made UPS develop new technology for better efficiency. A handheld device called Delivery Information Acquisition Device (DIAD) was created to record and upload delivery information to the UPS network immediately upon pickup by every UPS driver. In 1992, UPS began tracking all ground shipments electronically. In 1994, UPS.com debuted, and provided the perfect interface to make what was primarily internal operational information available for customer access. In 1995, UPS acquired SonicAir\nto offer service parts logistics and compete with Choice Logistics\n. In the same year UPS launched UPS Logistics Group to facilitate global supply chain management solutions and consulting for customer needs. In 1997, a walkout\nby the 185,000 members of the Teamsters\nshut down UPS for 16 days.[14]\n\nIn 1998, UPS Capital was established to enable companies to grow their business through a comprehensive menu of integrated financial services through UPS.[15]\n\nUPS acquired Challenge Air in 1999 to expand its operations in Latin America.[16]\n\n","On November 10, 1999, UPS became a public company.[17]\n\n","In 2001, UPS acquired. Mail Boxes Etc., Inc.\n[18]\n\nIn 2003 approximately 3,000 Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. were rebranded as The UPS Store\n.","In 2004, UPS entered the heavy freight\nbusiness with purchase of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding\n, a former subsidiary of Menlo Worldwide\n. UPS rebranded it as UPS Supply Chain Solutions. The purchase price was US$150\u0026#160;million and the assumption of US$110\u0026#160;million in long-term debt. On August 5, 2005, UPS announced that it has completed its acquisition of less-than-truckload (LTL) trucking company Overnite Transportation for US$1.25\u0026#160;billion.[19]\n\nThis was approved by the FTC\nand Overnite shareholders on August 4, 2005. In 2005 UPS offered non-stop delivery service between Guangzhou\nand the United States.[20]\n\nOn April 28, 2006, Overnite officially became UPS Freight\n. On October 3, 2005, UPS completed the purchase of LYNX Express Ltd\n, one of the largest independent parcel carriers in the United Kingdom, for £\n55.5\u0026#160;million (US$97.1\u0026#160;million) after receiving approval for the transaction from the European Commission\n. The first joint package car center operation, in Dartford\n, Kent, is opened in 2006.","On August 28, 2007, United Parcel Service celebrated its 100th anniversary.[21]\n\nAll Nippon Airways\n, a Star Alliance\nmember, and UPS formed a cargo alliance and code-share to transport member cargo in 2008, similarly to an airline alliance\n.[22]\n\nOn March 19, 2012, UPS announced that it intended to acquire TNT Express\nfor $6.8 billion, in a move to help expand its presence in European and Asian markets.[23]\n\nHowever, the deal fell through in January 2013 after it was announced that UPS had failed to obtain permission from the European Commission and as such had been blocked on competition grounds.[24]\n\nIn February 2012 UPS acquired Brussels\n-based company Kiala that provides e-commerce retailers the option to have goods delivered to a conventional retail location.[25]\n\n","UPS's primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages and documents worldwide. In recent years, UPS has extended its service portfolio to include less than truckload\n(LTL) transportation (primarily in the U.S.) and supply chain\nservices. UPS reports its operations in three segments: U.S. Domestic Package operations, International Package operations, and Supply Chain \u0026amp; Freight operations.","U.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents, and packages throughout the United States.","International Package operations include delivery to more than 220 countries and territories worldwide,[26]\n\nincluding shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or distribution outside the United States.","Supply Chain \u0026amp; Freight (UPS-SCS for UPS Supply Chain Solutions) includes UPS' forwarding\nand contract logistics\noperations, UPS Freight\n, and other related business units. UPS' forwarding and logistics business provides services in more than 175 countries and territories worldwide, and includes worldwide supply chain design, execution and management, freight forwarding and distribution, customs brokerage, mail and consulting services. UPS Freight offers a variety of less than truckload (\"LTL\") and truckload (\"TL\") services to customers in North America.","Other business units within this segment include The UPS Store\nand UPS Capital.[27]\n\n","UPS employs approximately 444,000 staff: 362,000 in the U.S. and 82,000 internationally.[29]\n\nApproximately 240,000 UPS drivers, package handlers and clerks are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters\n. During the 1997 United Parcel Service strike\n, the company's only nationwide strike in its history, which lasted 16 days, Teamster President Ron Carey\nnegotiated a new contract for workers.[30]\n\n","Major competitors in the United States include United States Postal Service\n(USPS) and FedEx\n, as well as regional US carriers such as OnTrac\n, Eastern Connection, and LSO\n, formerly known as Lonestar Overnight. In addition to these domestic carriers, UPS competes with a variety of international operators, including Canada Post\n(and its subsidiary Purolator\n), TransForce\n, Deutsche Post\n(and its subsidiary DHL\n), Royal Mail\n, Japan Post\n, India Post\nand many other regional carriers, national postal services and air cargo handlers (see Package delivery\nand Mail\npages).","Historically, the bulk of UPS' competition came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post\n(USPS) or Choice Logistics\n. But in 1998 FedEx expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring\nRPS\n(originally Roadway Package System) and rebranding it as FedEx Ground\nin 2000. In 2003 DHL expanded its US operations by acquiring Airborne Express\n, significantly increasing its presence in the United States, and adding more competition in the ground delivery market. In response to this, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations,[32]\n\na program that allows UPS to pick up mail \u0026amp; packages separately from the main Ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU),[33]\n\nfor final distribution. This process is also known as zone skipping,[34]\n\nlong used by Parcel Consolidators.[35]\n\nUPS also has a separate product called \"SurePost\" which uses the UPS Ground network to deliver packages to the nearest UPS Package Center, which transfers them to the USPS DDU for \"final mile\" delivery.[36]\n\n","More recently, the continued growth of online shopping\n, combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation (including package delivery) has on the environment\n, has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents. For instance, the US Postal Service\nclaims \"greener delivery\" of parcels on the assumption that USPS letter carriers deliver to each US address, six days a week anyway, and therefore offer the industry's lowest fuel consumption per delivery. Other carriers, like ParcelPool.com,[37]\n\nwhich specializes in residential package delivery to APO/FPO\naddresses, Hawaii\n, Alaska\n, Puerto Rico\n, and other US Territories, arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online e-tailers for low-cost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery.","UPS refers to its delivery van\nas a \"package car\". The company utilizes several designs and sizes of package cars, dependent on routes and package volume. The rounded-nose design of fiberglass hood of the UPS package car was patented by the company in 1965.[38]\n\nMorgan Olson\n(Grumman Olson), Union City Body\n, and Utilimaster\nmanufacture the bodies for UPS delivery vans; older vehicles are based on Ford or General Motors P-chassis, while package cars introduced since the 1990s are based on Freightliner, Navistar, or Workhorse chassis. Originally, UPS delivery vehicles were equipped with manual transmissions and steering, although many newer vehicles are updated with automatic transmissions. In a 2010s redesign of the hood, the rounded-nose design has been phased out; its sealed-beam headlights have been replaced with automotive-sourced composite headlight units faired into the hood.","Along with its large delivery vans, for smaller routes, the company utilizes brown-painted delivery vehicles based on off-the-shelf production vehicles, including minivans (including the Ford Transit Connect\nand Dodge Grand Caravan\n) and Mercedes-Benz (Dodge/Freightliner) Sprinter\nbox vans. UPS has ordered Modec\nelectric vans\nfor its UK and German fleets. Energy costs play a huge part in the potential profitability of package delivery companies like DHL and FedEx.[39]\n\n","When UPS ground vehicles reach the end of their useful service life and are no longer roadworthy (typically 20–25 years or more, but generally when the body's structural integrity is compromised), they are almost always stripped of reusable parts, repainted in household paint to cover up the trademark, and then sent to the scrapyard to be crushed and broken up. The only exception to this policy is when a package car is repainted white for internal use, usually at a large hub. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle's destruction, as UPS does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles.","The UPS package car (delivery van\n) is a major symbol of the U.S. business world, with its iconic status referenced in an early 2000s ad campaign following UPS' sponsorship of Dale Jarrett\nin the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series\n: the ads were about how the company would prefer to race the truck over a stock car despite the futility of doing so, as \"people love the truck\".","UPS commonly refers to its ground package tractor-trailers as \"feeders\"; these vehicles are distinct from the UPS Freight\nfleet. In line with its delivery vehicles, nearly all UPS tractor units\nare painted in a Pullman brown livery. Prior to the 1990s, many tractors were of cabover\nconfiguration; as trailer-length laws were revised in the United States, the company transitioned towards the use of conventional-style semitractor. As of 2017, nearly the entire UPS semitractor fleet consists of conventional-cab trucks.","In North America, UPS utilizes a fleet of trucks from several manufacturers, including Mack Trucks\n(the Pinnacle and Vision) and Navistar\n(International ProStar+\nand 9900i\n), along with PACCAR vehicles (Kenworth\nT800, T660 and T680). Older vehicles in the fleet include Ford/Sterling tractors (Aeromax/A-Line\n), Freightliner (Argosy\n, the final cabover truck used by UPS); Mack CH and International 8100 tractors are in the process of being phased out. As part of a company policy to avoid advertisement or endorsement of a vehicle manufacturer, whenever possible, the manufacturer emblems and badging are removed when a vehicle enters service.","Previous trucks used by UPS include the Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, International 8100/8200, International 9670, GMC Astro, Peterbilt 362, Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, WhiteGMC High Cabover/Road Commander II, Mack CH, Mack MH UltraLiner, Mack F, and Diamond T/Diamond Reo cabovers. At one time[when?\n\n\n]\n, UPS used electric-powered trucks (made by White Motors\n) for deliveries in Manhattan, NYC. There were only a few hundred of them, but they were notable for their \"spooky silence\" when running[citation needed\n\n\n]\n.","Painted a light gray, company-owned semitrailers\nare distinguished by a large UPS emblem on the forward portion of the trailer sides; newer trailers are distinguished by the fitment of trailer skirts\n. Designed in several configurations, UPS uses several lengths of trailers (28, 45, 48, and 53 feet). Along with standard flat-bottom van trailers, there are drop-frame trailers (largely being phased out of the fleet) and trailer-on-flatcar trailers (TOFC); the latter are trailers designed for transport on railroad cars.","Dependent on state and provincial regulations, many UPS short trailers are towed in tandem.","In 2008, UPS started hiring bicycle delivery personnel in Vancouver, Washington\n, and in several cities in Oregon (Portland\n, Salem\n, Corvallis\n, Eugene\n, and Medford\n).[40]\n\n","UPS contracts with several railroad companies in the United States to provide intermodal\ntransport for its cargo.","UPS Airlines consists of 236 aircraft that serves over 200 countries and territories worldwide.[41]\n\n[42]\n\nBased out of Louisville, Kentucky\n(home to Worldport\n, its worldwide air hub), UPS Airlines operates several major hubs throughout the United States. In addition to Worldport, the largest UPS hubs in the United States are located in Rockford, Illinois\n(Chicago) and Philadelphia\n.","Outside of North America, a hub in Cologne, Germany\nservices Europe; in Asia, UPS Airlines operates a facility in Hong Kong and two hubs in mainland China.","The company announced a non-stop daily flight from Louisville, KY to Dubai\nas part of their expansion of making Dubai Airport\ntheir logistics hub for the Middle-East, Africa, and Indian-Subcontinent.[43]\n\n","The brown color that UPS uses on its vehicles and uniforms is called Pullman\nBrown\n. Company founder James E. Casey originally wanted company vehicles to use a yellow paint scheme, but one of his partners, Charlie Soderstrom, stated that a yellow vehicle would be hard to keep clean and that Pullman railroad cars\nwere brown for just that reason.[5]\n\n","During the 2000s, the company used the familiarity of its color scheme in an advertising slogan: \"What can Brown do for you?\"\n[44]\n\n","UPS commissioned brand consultancy FutureBrand to develop its own font, UPS Sans\n, for use in marketing and communication material. UPS Sans\nwas created by slightly altering certain parts of FSI FontShop International\n's font FF Dax\n\nwithout permission. This has resulted in an agreement between FSI FontShop International and FutureBrand to avoid litigation.[45]\n\n","As of 2013, UPS has over 104,900 vehicles in operation worldwide including nearly 7,000 alternative-fuel vehicles.[2]\n\nIn May 2008 UPS placed an order for 200 hybrid electric vehicles\n(adding to the 50 it had at that point) and 300 compressed natural gas\n(which are 20% more fuel efficient, and add to the 800 it already has) vehicles from Daimler Trucks North America\n.[46]\n\n[47]\n\n[48]\n\n","UPS received a \"striding\" rating of 80 points out of 100 totals on the environmental scorecard by the Climate Counts Group for its efforts to lessen the company's impact on the environment.[49]\n\nUPS has also been awarded the Clean Air Excellence Award by the United States Environmental Protection Agency\nbecause of the alternative fuel program it has developed.[50]\n\n","In October 2009, UPS became the first small-package carrier to offer customers the chance to buy carbon offsets\nto neutralize the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transport of their packages. Although initially only available on ups.com and to high-volume shippers, they are now widely available through UPS shipping systems and UPS Ready third-party shipping systems.[51]\n\n[52]\n\n","On May 26, 2017, A federal judge ordered United Parcel Service to pay nearly $247 million in damages and penalties for illegally shipping large amounts of untaxed cigarettes in New York\n.[53]\n\n","Allen, Joe, The Package King: A Rank and File History of United Parcel Service,

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df010262df3aa1b2f56b"},"content":{"contents":["Waffle House, Inc.,\nis an American restaurant chain\nwith more than 2,100 locations in 25 states in the United States\n.[1]\n\nMost of the locations are in the South\n, where the chain is a regional cultural icon.[2]\n\nWaffle House is headquartered in an unincorporated\npart of Gwinnett County, Georgia\n,[3]\n\nnear Norcross\n.[4]\n\n","","","The first Waffle House opened on Labor Day\nweekend in 1955 at 2719 East College Avenue in Avondale Estates, Georgia\n.[1]\n\nThat restaurant was conceived and founded by Joe Rogers Sr.\n(1919–2017) and Tom Forkner\n(1918–2017).[1]\n\n[5]\n\nRogers started in the restaurant business as a short-order cook in 1947 at the Toddle House\nin New Haven, Connecticut\n.[6]\n\nBy 1949, he became a regional manager[2]\n\nwith the now-defunct Memphis\n-based Toddle House chain, then he moved to Atlanta\n. He met Tom Forkner while buying a house from him in Avondale Estates.[1]\n\n","Rogers's concept was to combine the speed of fast food with table service with around-the-clock availability. He told Forkner, \"...You build a restaurant, and I’ll show you how to run it,\" recalls Tom Forkner.[2]\n\n","Forkner suggested naming the restaurant Waffle House, as waffles\nwere the most profitable item on the 16-item menu. The fragile nature of waffles also made the point that it was a dine-in, not a carry-out, restaurant, but it confused patrons as to meal availability other than breakfast.[2]\n\n","Rogers continued to work with Toddle House, and to avoid conflict of interest, sold his interest to Forkner in 1956. In 1960, when Rogers asked to buy into Toddle House, and they refused, he moved back to Atlanta and rejoined Waffle House, now a chain of three restaurants, to run restaurant operations.[6]\n\nShortly after Joe returned full-time, Tom followed suit and left Ben S. Forkner Realty.","After opening a fourth restaurant in 1960, the company began franchising\nits restaurants and slowly grew to 27 stores by the late 1960s, before growth accelerated. The company is privately held and does not disclose annual sales figures, but says they serve 2% of the eggs used in the nation's food-service industry. The founders limit their involvement in management, and as of 2013[update]\n\n, Joe Rogers, Jr.\nwas CEO and retired late 2013, and Bert Thornton\nis President.[2]\n\n","Although the Waffle House chain is concentrated in the Southeast, it has reached as far to the north as Austinburg, Ohio\n, near Ashtabula, as far to the west as Goodyear, Arizona\n, in the suburbs of Phoenix, as far to the south as Key Largo, Florida\n, and as far to the east as Bethlehem, Pennsylvania\n.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","In 2007, Waffle House repurchased the original restaurant, which was sold by the chain in the early 1970s and was most recently a Chinese restaurant\n. The company restored it using original blueprints for use as a private company museum. The museum is used primarily for internal corporate events and tours and is occasionally open to the public.[7]\n\n","In 2008, one of the biggest Waffle House franchises in the southeast, North Lake Foods, was bought out by Waffle House, Inc. North Lake Foods filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection\nand closed some stores. Waffle House, Inc. plans to rehabilitate the franchise. In early 2009, East Coast Waffles bought North Lake Foods to become a new franchise.[8]\n\n","The founders of the Waffle House brand died in 2017 within two months of each other: Joe Rogers Sr. died on March 3 and Tom Forkner on April 26.[9]\n\n","The chain's restaurants almost always have jukeboxes\n, which have traditionally played 45-rpm singles\n[10]\n\nand, in some cases, CDs. Often, the entire first column of selections and much of the second column would have songs about Waffle House and its food. Many of the songs are written and/or sung by people with connections to the chain, such as Mary Welch Rogers\n. The songs are on ordinary discs, which are produced for Waffle House and are not commercially sold, but the chain has made a CD of some of the songs available for sale.[11]\n\nIn 2012-13, most (if not all) of the locations have removed the 45-rpm/CD jukeboxes in favor of digital touchscreen jukeboxes, which, at Waffle House restaurants, still feature all of the original Waffle House songs.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Waffle House provides reservation, candlelight service on e's Day\nbeginning in 2008 with one restaurant in Johns Creek, Georgia\n, and growing into over 30 in 2009.[12]\n\n","The servers use a proprietary version of diner lingo\nto call in orders, and the menu suggests some use of the same lingo when placing orders for hash brown potatoes\n: \"scattered\" (spread on the grill), \"smothered\" (with onions), \"covered\" (with cheese), \"chunked\" (with diced ham), \"diced\" (with diced tomatoes), \"peppered\" (with jalapeño peppers), \"capped\" (with mushrooms), \"topped\" (with chili), and \"all the way\" (with all available toppings). The option of \"country\" was added for hash browns with sausage gravy\non them.[13]\n\nAdditionally, the company has a symbolic code by which grill operators are told the specific orders that go on each customer's plate; a 2017 ESPN.com\n\nstory gave the following overview of this code:","Using accoutrements such as jelly packets, mayonnaise packets, pickles, cheese and hash brown pieces, grill operators are told what orders go on which plates. A jelly packet at the bottom of the plate signifies scrambled eggs. Raisin toast is signified by a packet of apple butter. A mustard packet facing up means a pork chop. Face-down means country ham. A pat of butter is a T-bone\n, and its place on the plate determines how the steak cooked, from well done at the top to rare at the bottom.[13]\n\n","The company claims to be the world's largest seller of several of its menu items—the namesake waffles, ham, pork chops, grits, and T-bone steaks. It also claims that it serves 2% of all eggs in the U.S.[13]\n\n","For years, Waffle House was known as \"Waffle \u0026amp; Steak\" in Indiana due to another chain of restaurants owning the rights to the Waffle House name in the state.[14]\n\nReportedly, the original Indiana Waffle House chain has started using the name \"Sunshine Cafe\".[15]\n\nHowever, the d/b/a\nfor \"Sunshine Cafe\" belongs to \"Waffle House Greenwood Inc.\", established in 1981. The oldest \"Waffle House\" entity listed with the Corporations office of the Indiana Secretary of State is \"Waffle House of Bloomington, Indiana\n, Inc.\" established in 1967, and like Waffle House Greenwood, it is still an active corporation.[16]\n\nThe Bloomington operation, noted for being the city's second oldest restaurant, closed in 2013 and was demolished to make way for an apartment complex.[17]\n\n(Many of the Waffle House corporations in Indiana have been dissolved.) \"Waffle House Inc.\" of Norcross, Georgia registered with Indiana in 1974. In 2005, the Waffle \u0026amp; Steak restaurants all adopted the \"Waffle House\" moniker, bringing the entire chain under the iconic name.[16]\n\n","In 2004, in response to a serious Salmonella\n\nproblem in 2003 at a ref=\"/wiki/Vernon_Hills,_Illinois\" title=\"Vernon Hills, Illinois\"\u003eVernon Hills, Illinois\n,[18]\n\nand by four deaths\nin 1993 from E. coli\n\nin undercooked hamburger\nat a Jack in the Box\n, [19]\n\nthe television news magazine Dateline NBC\n\nin investigated sanitation practices of popular American family restaurant chains, measuring the number of critical violations per inspection. The Waffle House averaged 1.6 critical violations per inspection.[20]\n\n[dead link\n\n\n]\n\nWaffle House's response to the study pointed out that they prepare all meals in an open kitchen, and consumers can readily observe their sanitation practices themselves.[21]\n\n","Waffle House has a history of supporting conservative\nRepublicans\n. In 2012 Waffle House donated $100,000 to American Crossroads\n, the super PAC\nfounded by Karl Rove\n.[22]\n\nWaffle House also donated $50,000 to Restore Our Future\n, a Super-PAC created to boost Mitt Romney\n's 2012 presidential bid. In their home state, Waffle House has supported many of Georgia's congressional Republicans.[23]\n\nWaffle House Vice-President Don Balfour\nwas the longest serving Republican in the Georgia senate.[24]\n\n","As with other open-all-night eateries (including White Castle\n, Krystal\n, /a\u003e, and Krispy Kreme\n), Waffle House has developed into a cultural icon. Part of their fame (especially that of Waffle House) is that they are so prominent along Interstate highways\nin the South. Jim Ridley wrote in 1997:\nThe Waffle House is everywhere in the South. It has inspired country songs, comedy routines, loving editorials, a scene in the movie Tin Cup\n\n, and even web sites and Internet newsgroups that breathlessly post late-breaking developments. With more than 1200 locations in 20 states, as far north as Ohio\nand as far west as Arizona\n, Waffle House is cherished by thousands of diners. Regular customers speak of its employees, its customs\n, and its food with near reverence. Touring musicians have been known to eat five meals a week there. Yet the Waffle House is so pervasive, it is invisible. It does not advertise; it hides in plain sight.[25]\n\n\n\nWaffle House is called the \"low-rent roadside cafe featuring waffles\n\" in the 1996 romantic comedy\nmovie\nTin Cup\n.[26]\n\nIt is also shown in the 2006 film ATL\n\n, and the movie Due Date\n\n, in which the main character selects that restaurant, despite being allergic to waffles. A Waffle House in Nashville was the setting for a routine by the stand-up comedian Bill Hicks\n.[27]\n\nThe aforementioned 2017 ESPN story stated, \"there's no business that has a more symbiotic relationship with college football\nfans of every stripe than the Waffle House.\" Waffle House is particularly popular among football fans from the Atlantic Coast Conference\nand the Southeastern Conference\n, with locations in college towns attracting crowds before and after football games.[13]\n\n\nWaffle House is referenced to in popular music, as in the songs \"The Bad Touch\n\" by the Bloodhound Gang\n, \"24 Hours\n\" by TeeFlii\nand \"Big Amount\n\" by 2 Chainz\n, in the title of the Hootie \u0026amp; the Blowfish\nalbum Scattered, Smothered and Covered\n\n, and in \"Welcome to Atlanta\n\" by Jermaine Dupri\n.\nDisaster recovery\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency\n, Waffle House is one of the top four corporations, along with Walmart\n, The Home Depot\n, and \n, for disaster response.[28]\n\nWaffle House has an extensive disaster management plan with on-site and portable generators and positioned food and ice ahead of severe weather events such as a hurricane\n. This helps mitigate the effects of a storm on the power grid and the supply chains.[29]\n\nThe company prepares 'jump teams' of recovery staff and supplies, brought in from outside disaster-affected areas, so that local staff can focus on helping their own homes and families. The ability of a Waffle House to remain open after a severe storm, possibly with a limited menu, is used by FEMA as a measure of disaster recovery known as the Waffle House index\n.[28]\n\n[30]\n\n\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n\n\nAtlanta portal\n\n\n\n\nCompanies portal\n\n\n\n\n\nFood portal\n\n\n\n\nGolden Nugget Pancake House\n\nIHOP\n\nThe Original Pancake House\n\nWalker Brothers\n\n\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n^ a\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n\"History\"\n.

A sister network, Weatherscan\n, is a digital cable\nand satellite service that offers 24-hour automated local forecasts and radar\nimagery.","The Weather Channel's former parent company, The Weather Company\n(part of IBM\nsince 2016), also provides forecasts for terrestrial and satellite radio\nstations, newspapers\n, mobile apps\nand websites\n, including an extensive online presence at weather.com\n.[1]\n\n[3]\n\nThe Weather Channel continues to license its brand assets and weather data from IBM.[1]\n\n","As of January 2016, The Weather Channel is received by 88 million households in America.[4]\n\n","","","The Weather Channel was founded on July 18, 1980,[5]\n\nby veteran television meteorologist John Coleman\n(who, at the time of the channel's founding, had formerly served as a chief meteorologist at ABC\nowned-and-operated station\nWLS-TV\nin Chicago\nand as a forecaster for Good Morning America\n\n) and Frank Batten\n, then-president of the channel's original owner Landmark Communications (now Landmark Media Enterprises\n). The channel launched at 8:00\u0026#160;p.m. Eastern Time\non May 2, 1982. Originally, regional and local information was obtained by the National Weather Service\nfor broadcast. Since 2002, all forecasting has been done on-site in Atlanta.[6]\n\n","The Weather Channel uses special proprietary equipment that inserts information\non current and future local weather conditions, and weather alerts issued by the National Weather Service\nand the Storm Prediction Center\nand National Hurricane Center\n, if it is viewed on a cable television provider. The original WeatherStar\ntechnology has been upgraded on larger cable systems to the IntelliStar\n, which incorporates \"Vocal Local\" to announce current conditions, weather bulletins and detailed local forecasts. Subscribers of satellite, IPTV\nand some smaller cable providers originally saw only a roundup of local TWC-sourced forecasts for major cities across the U.S., as well as national and regional satellite\nand radar images, and severe weather watch and warning maps when active. However, satellite customers with newer systems or interactive TV\nreceivers have the choice of \"roundups\" or localized forecasts. For both cable and satellite viewers, popular music (formerly smooth jazz\n) plays in the background during these segments. Some older WeatherStar units were still in use by small cable companies that couldn't afford to upgrade to the IntelliStar. The WeatherStar units are also able to overlay text-based local contact information over the national feed during certain business advertisements aired on the channel.","The Weather Channel operates a service based on modified versions of the WeatherStar technology called Weatherscan\n, a separate non-network TV channel\nwhich constantly displays local and regional conditions, and forecasts, along with The Weather Channel's logo, and on some cable systems, advertisements.","The Weather Channel also runs websites in Latin America\n(Canal de Tiempo\n), Brazil\n(Canal do Tempo\n), the United Kingdom\n(Weather Channel\n), France\n(Météo 123\n) and Germany\n(Wetter 123\n). TWC only runs its U.S. channel, although it does produce international forecasts. The Weather Channel also has Weather stations in national universities of the USA (MIT, University of California\n), UK (University of Oxford\n, Lancaster University\n) and Global Meteo Station at the North Pole\nand International Space Station\n.","A definitive history of the network, The Weather Channel: The Improbable Rise of a Media Phenomenon\n, by Jeffrey L. Cruikshank and network co-founder Frank Batten, was published by Harvard Business Press in May 2002, in honor of TWC's 20th anniversary.","On January 3, 2008, Landmark Communications\nput The Weather Channel and its assets up for sale.[7]\n\nOn July 6, 2008, NBC Universal\n, Bain Capital\nand Blackstone Group\nagreed to jointly purchase The Weather Channel from Landmark, making it the channel's first ownership change in 26 years.[8]\n\nThe sale was finalized on September 12, 2008. NBC Universal also owned NBC Weather Plus\n, a rival service which was carried by and featured content from the NBC\ntelevision network's local network affiliates\n; that service announced its discontinuation three months later. Over-the-air\ndigital subchannels\ncarrying Weather Plus have since switched to the similarly formatted The Local AccuWeather Channel\n, kept the Weather Plus engine, or switched affiliations to other networks such as This TV\nor the Retro Television Network\n; some have shut down entirely.","From November 2008 to February 2009, The Weather Channel laid off seven long-time on-camera meteorologists: Kristina Abernathy, Eboni Deon\n, Kristin Dodd, Rich Johnson, Cheryl Lemke, Mark Mancuso\nand Dave Schwartz\n(Schwartz would return to TWC in April 2014,[9]\n\n[10]\n\nbut died of cancer on July 30, 2016). With the exception of Deon, all had been on the air for more than ten years, and three of them had been employed by the network for more than twenty years. In July 2010, The Weather Channel terminated Bill Keneely\n, the last of the original on-camera meteorologists who appeared on the network's first broadcasts in 1982. In December of that year, the network also laid off on-camera meteorologist Nicole Mitchell\n, who later would file a lawsuit against The Weather Channel in 2012, alleging that she had been terminated because the channel's new owners disapproved of the time required by her simultaneous duties as a Captain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve\nas one of the \"Hurricane Hunters\n\" team;[11]\n\nsuch reserve duties are protected by U.S. law (Mitchell later served as the chief meteorologist at Al Jazeera America\n, which for a time also employed Eboni Deon).","Inevitably, the merger of NBC on-air meteorologists began in May 2009. Former NBC Weather Plus meteorologist Todd Santos joined The Weather Channel on May 2 of that year. Al Roker\nof NBC's Today\n\nbegan hosting a one-hour morning program called Wake Up With Al\n\n, alongside meteorologist Stephanie Abrams later in the summer. However, for New York City-based forecasting operations (those utilized for forecasts on MSNBC\nand CNBC\n, for instance), the former NBC Weather Plus forecasting, radar and graphics systems remain in place, with banners changed to fit The Weather Channel's graphics scheme. On September 10, 2009, The Weather Channel co-founder Frank Batten\ndied.[12]\n\n[13]\n\n","In January 2012, David Kenny\ntook over as chief executive officer\nof The Weather Channel, replacing former AOL\nexecutive Mike Kelly\n, who had been appointed as the company's CEO in the summer of 2009. Although all operations, sales support and marketing and the bulk of employees are located in the headquarters in Atlanta, Kenny declined to move there, and continues to live and work from his home in Boston\n,[14]\n\nvisiting Atlanta once or twice per quarter. This is counter to general company policy which discourages telecommuting for the majority of employees.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nLater in 2012, The Weather Channel's holding company\nchanged its name from The Weather Channel Companies to The Weather Company\n.[3]\n\nThe company also purchased competing weather service and website Weather Underground\nthe same year. On March 10, 2015, Verizon FiOS\ndropped The Weather Channel and WeatherScan for their rival AccuWeather\n.","On September 9, 2015, the channel announced a phased overhaul of its programming schedule during 2016, in which the channel would gradually shift its focus back towards a forecast-based lineup; the channel cancelled Wake Up with Al\n(citing high production costs as it was produced in New York city rather than Atlanta) and announced that AMHQ\nwould be reformatted as a weather-focused program (eliminating lifestyle segments), with Stephanie Abrams\ntaking over as host while original host Sam Champion would become a contributor for its prime time schedule starting November 2. The network also announced it would no longer greenlight original long-form programming, and expand live forecast programming on its schedule throughout 2016 once all remaining long-form programs already in development conclude their runs. In a memo sent out to network staff by Weather Company CEO David Kenny, it cited the refocusing towards weather-based programs was done on the basis that \"our most passionate fans come to us for the weather and the science behind the weather, not our original shows.\" Around 50 TWC employees – including production, engineering, and financial staff – were laid off, and the television channel's budget was reduced to focus investments on the company's Internet and mobile properties.[15]\n\n[16]\n\n[17]\n\n[18]\n\n","The channel's original format was akin to that of a news and information cable network. Since the creation of the series Atmospheres\n\nin 2000 and Storm Stories\n\nin 2003, The Weather Channel had seen a gradual transition toward a mix of weather forecast programming and weather-related entertainment programming that paralleled the launch of sister network Weatherscan\n, the evolution of the always-on \"L\" bar/weather ticker, the development of weather.com and popular branded mobile phone applications, and the increased viewing and interest in documentary programs on the topic of weather. In November 2013, the channel introduced a new initiative of \"weather all the time\" in response to the criticism; all original programming – which was rebranded under the tagline Natural Drama\n– now had direct relevance to weather-related subjects, and the network reemphasized its promise to interrupt original programming either regionally or nationally during major weather events; in addition, The Weather Channel extended the display of its lower display line\n(which also experienced a design revamp as part of the introduction of a new graphics package) to commercial breaks and through entire broadcasts of its original programs.[19]\n\n","In August 2015, reports surfaced that The Weather Company's owners were considering a sale of all or part of the venture, having hired Morgan Stanley\nand PJT Partners to explore their options.[20]\n\nOn October 28, 2015, it was announced that IBM\nwould acquire most of The Weather Company's assets, including weather.com, Weather Underground, the related mobile applications, and their underlying data platforms, for an undisclosed amount.[21]\n\nIBM plans to leverage its Watson\ntechnology as part of the acquisition, foreseeing its use for weather analytics and predictions. The deal, which closed the following January,[1]\n\ndoes not include The Weather Channel itself, which remains owned by the Bain/Blackstone/NBCUniversal consortium, and entered into a long-term licensing agreement with IBM for use of its weather data and \"The Weather Channel\" name and branding.[21]\n\n[22]\n\n[23]\n\n[23]\n\n","In August 2016, reports surfaced that Sinclair Broadcast Group\nexpressed interest in acquiring ownership of The Weather Channel.[24]\n\n","Over the years, attempts to broadcast international versions of TWC – apart from the Australian version of The Weather Channel (now Sky News Weather Channel\n) – have failed. TWC also operates websites that provide localized forecasts in Brazil\n, France\n, Germany\n, India\n, Latin America\nand the United Kingdom\n, but some of these sites apparently have not been developed further since 2003. The Weather Channel also shares radar imagery and forecasts with The Weather Network\nin Canada, particularly for The Weather Channel's Canadian forecasts.","Since its inception, The Weather Channel has broadcast segments providing local weather observations and forecasts generated by WeatherStar\nsystems (\"STAR\" being an acronym for Satellite Transponder Addressable Receiver), proprietary computer units that are installed at the headends\nof individual cable providers. Until 1995, the forecast segments aired at various times each hour, but are currently shown at times ending in \"8\" – as such, in 1996 (although it would not be used full-time until 2002), the channel adopted \"Local on the 8s\" as the title for the segments (though local forecast segments aired on the channel are reduced to once per half-hour whenever non-forecast programs air). With the introduction of the IntelliStar system (the sixth-generation STAR system, which was introduced in 2002), traffic information was also generated that provided roadway flow, construction and accident information for metropolitan areas\nwhere traffic.com\n(via its TrafficPulse service) provides traffic data; however, this feature was eliminated from the IntelliStar's programmed \"flavors\" (the arrangements of specialized segments played during individual local forecasts) when traffic.com ended its content agreement with TWC in 2010.","The WeatherStar systems also utilize a Lower Display Line (LDL) that appears at the bottom of the screen during all programming (until November 2013, it had been limited to only local forecasts and national programming, while being removed from the screen during commercial breaks), providing current conditions for a specific location and two or three towns within 15 miles, almanac data and forecasts on cable headends using the IntelliStar system, and only current conditions and forecasts on cable headends using STAR models from WeatherStar XL\nand older. WeatherStar units also allow cable providers to scroll text messages\nwhen in use, including the capability to broadcast severe weather advisories and warnings in effect for the jurisdiction in which the WeatherStar system's cable headend is located and its immediate surrounding area.","When the HD feed was launched, none of the channel's programming was actually presented in high definition, outside of a national \"satellite\" version of the \"Local on the 8s\" segment; Epic Conditions\n\nand WeatherVentures\n\nbecame the channel's first two programs to be presented in HD, when they premiered on October 1, 2007. TWC began broadcasting studio programming in high definition on June 2, 2008, with the introduction of a new studio that features various environmentally friendly technologies.","The IntelliStar 2, the seventh-generation STAR system and the first to generate graphical weather data in HD, was officially released in July 2010 (although similar to previous recent STAR systems, among its modifications include an animated Lower Display Line and a Vocal Local narration track recorded by TWC meteorologist Jim Cantore\n).[citation needed\n\n\n]\nThe system was gradually rolled out to major U.S. cable providers strictly for use on the HD feed, and would not replace existing operational STAR units from IntelliStar and older used on TWC's standard definition feed or Weatherscan, making it one of the few channels which by necessity does not have an \"autotune to HD\" version for providers that utilize set-top boxes allowing HD tuning to standard definition channel positions, unless the HD version has local forecast capabilities. As of August 2015, some providers (such as Comcast) are using the IntelliStar 2 on the standard definition channel in some locations.[25]\n\nDirecTV began carrying the \"Local on the 8s\" segment in HD via an app on set-top boxes on September 29, 2009.[26]\n\n","The Weather Channel provides forecasts for satellite radio\nprovider Sirius XM Radio\nin the United States. Both services run regional forecasts on a single station, and operate several individual stations providing combined local weather and traffic information for major metropolitan areas.","TWC also maintains content partnerships with a number of local U.S. radio stations to provide local forecasts, using announcers separate from the meteorologists seen on the television channel. For some affiliates, The Weather Channel provides a limited amount of live coverage during local severe weather\nevents (with the Georgia-based announcers connected via ISDN\n). Distribution of TWC radio content is currently handled by Westwood One\n.","Similarly, The Weather Channel also provides weather reports for a number of newspapers around the United States. This included a half-page national forecast for USA Today\n\n, for which TWC provided content until September 2012, when rival AccuWeather\nreplaced The Weather Channel as the paper's forecast provider[27]\n\nwith TWC's forecasts being replaced with AccuWeather's on the USAToday.com website one month later.","TWC provided numerous customized forecasts for online users through its website, weather.com, including home and garden, and event planning forecasts. Third-party web analytics\nproviders Alexa\nand SimilarWeb\nrated the site as the 146th and 244th most visited website in the world respectively, as of July 2015.[28]\n\n[29]\n\nSimilarWeb rates the site as the second most visited weather website globally, attracting more than 126 million visitors per month.[29]\n\n[30]\n\n","It also provided WAP\naccess for mobile phone users, desktop widgets\nfor quick reference by computer users, and customized weather feeds for individual websites. Cell phone customers could also receive local forecasts from TWC sent to their mobile handsets via SMS\nby sending a text message\nwith their ZIP code\nto 42278 (which spells \"4cast\"). The Weather Channel also provided weather forecasts for other online services including Yahoo!\n.[31]\n\n","In addition, The Weather Channel maintained apps for the iPhone\n, iPad\n, Android\n, Apple TV\n, Kindle Fire\n, and Windows\nmobile and tablet platforms. TWC formerly maintained two versions of its mobile applications: a free version that incorporates advertising and a pay version called \"TWC Max\" that does not feature advertising, the latter was discontinued in favor of an all ad-supported model on January 6, 2014\n. Aside from location-based weather forecast information, the apps provided radar maps, and tropical and seasonal updates, as well as social media\nrelated functions that track weather-related Twitter\nmessages and allow users to send Facebook\nfriends severe weather alerts. The channel also disseminated severe weather information, and photos and videos submitted by meteorologists and viewers, on its Twitter feed (@TWCBreaking\n, which also served as a hashtag\nusable for posts).","In July 2012, The Weather Company\n(former owner of The Weather Channel) purchased competing weather website Weather Underground\n. While The Weather Channel already had success with its own mobile apps, it planned to use Weather Underground's large network of digital forecasting and tracking websites to bolster its digital growth. Weather Underground operates separately from The Weather Channel and continues to provide its own forecasts, though its website incorporates some weather news and video content from TWC.[32]\n\n","The website weather.com\nand most of The Weather Channel's digital assets were sold to IBM\nin January 2016.[1]\n\n","Weather forecast programming made up TWC's entire schedule prior to its incorporation of weather-related original programming – referred in network promotional materials and press releases as \"long-form programming\" – in 2000 (with few breakaways from its forecast programs prior to then, outside of educational program The Weather Classroom\n\n, an original program produced as part of the cable television industry's Cable in the Classroom\ninitiative). The number of hours devoted to TWC's in-studio forecast programs have steadily eroded since then. The network's live studio programs air regularly from 5:00\u0026#160;a.m. to 8:00\u0026#160;p.m. Eastern Time on weekdays and 5:00\u0026#160;a.m. to 12:00\u0026#160;p.m. Eastern Time on weekends and holidays. href=\"/wiki/America%27s_Morning_Headquarters\" title=\"America's Morning Headquarters\"\u003eAMHQ\n\nairs weekdays between 5:00 and 9:00\u0026#160;a.m. Eastern Time; these are followed by The Weather Channel's flagship program, Weather Center Live\n\nwhich airs from 9:00\u0026#160;a.m. to 6:00\u0026#160;p.m. Eastern., and the network's evening program, Weather Underground\nwhich airs from 6:00\u0026#160;p.m. to 8:00\u0026#160;p.m. Eastern. On weekends, AMHQ\nairs from 5:00\u0026#160;a.m. to 9:00\u0026#160;a.m., followed by Weekend Recharge\nfrom 9:00\u0026#160;am to 12:00\u0026#160;p.m.","The Weather Channel also broadcasts original weather-related documentary/entertainment series and specials\n. These programs run from 8:00\u0026#160;p.m. to 5:00\u0026#160;a.m. Eastern Time on weekdays and 12:00\u0026#160;p.m. to 5:00\u0026#160;a.m. Eastern Time on weekends and holidays (they also run from 12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Mondays). During severe weather events affecting portions of the United States, The Weather Channel may preempt original programming in favor of airing special extended editions of Weather Center Live\n(which move the color of the word \"LIVE\" from blue to red) to provide long-form coverage and analysis until it stops; in some events, the on-air graphics (including Lower Display Line) can go black-and-red (similar to colors that WCL uses); pre-emptions vary between local (isolated to viewers in the region affected by a particular weather event) and nationwide, depending upon the impact of the weather phenomenon/story and if a local provider utilizes a later model WeatherStar unit that allows the use of dual feeds that can substitute programming with long-form weather coverage in a given area. And also, during all of these events, the jingles that WCL uses is used to replace the normal one on Local on the 8's.","In a move that caused controversy with many longtime viewers, The Weather Channel began airing weather-related movies on Friday nights on October 30, 2009. The first feature to be broadcast by the channel was the 2000 film The Perfect Storm\n\n.[33]\n\n","After December 2009, these weekly movies were discontinued for the time being in favor of running Weather Center\n\n, which already aired throughout primetime during the rest of the work week. Despite the controversy, the Friday night film block resumed on March 26, 2010 under the title \"Flick and a Forecast,\" co-hosted by The Weather Channel meteorologist Jen Carfagno and MSNBC contributor Touré\n, with the documentary Into Thin Air: Deaths on Everest\n\n. During the broadcasts, the Lower Display Line that normally appears on TWC shows to provide local weather information (with breakaways during forecast and most long-form programs only for commercial breaks) was removed, appearing only a few times each hour during the film as a substitute for the standard \"Local on the 8s\" segments, with a translucent TWC logo bug appearing at other times during the film when the LDL was not on-screen.","While the films shown within the \"Flick and a Forecast\" block were weather-related in some form, some films featured (such as Misery\n\nand Deep Blue Sea\n\n) had only a minimal tie to weather. On May 31, 2010, NewsBlues\n\nreported The Weather Channel's decision to cancel the movie block, due in part to viewer criticism of movies being shown on what is intended as a news and information channel, as well as a snafu that occurred during an April 2010 tornado outbreak that led to a scheduled movie being aired instead of wall-to-wall severe weather coverage. The \"Flick and a Forecast\" presentations were then replaced by an additional hour of Weather Center\nand a two-hour block of long-form original programs.","The Weather Channel's first and most recognized logo was a blue rectangular box with rounded edges that debuted with The Weather Channel's first broadcast on May 2, 1982. This logo was revised in 1996, with the corners becoming less rounded and the logo becoming slightly flat. The weather.com\nURL text was permanently added underneath the logo in 1999. On August 15, 2005, the logo was overhauled again; the logo became a straight-edged square with no white trim on the edge and \"The Weather Channel\" text became oriented in title-case and left-justified, similar to its Canadian sister channel The Weather Network\n. A 25th-anniversary logo used in 2007 featured a white square edged in blue connected to the current logo with the text \"25 YEARS\" inside it in blue.","When NBCUniversal acquired the network in 2008, the network has participated in the \"Green is Universal\" campaign, which occurs twice a year, usually during April and November. The network's logo changes to a shade of green as part of the campaign promoting environmental conservation.","On May 20, 2010, Dish Network\nannounced that it was dropping The Weather Channel at 12:00\u0026#160;a.m. Eastern Time that day in favor of its own similar weather information channel, The Weather Cast\n. The carriage dispute\nwas over the rates that The Weather Channel asked Dish Network to pay: from 11¢ per subscriber per month[35]\n\nto 12¢,[36]\n\na 9% increase, totaling $140,000 per month. The dispute was also over The Weather Channel's programming format shifting from an information-based channel to an entertainment-based service.[37]\n\nThe Weather Channel said in a statement, \"Dish has chosen to be the first distributor to drop The Weather Channel rather than pay the standard industry rates others in the industry have already agreed to pay\",[36]\n\nand encouraged Dish Network customers to switch to other pay television providers. Dave Shull, senior vice president for programming for Dish Network said The Weather Channel's fees were harder for the satellite provider to justify paying as more people receive weather information through the internet and mobile services: \"They're looking for bid increases when I feel like there's a real migration to the Web, and it's difficult to really justify those rate increases at this time.\"[38]\n\n","On May 24, 2010, The Weather Channel announced that it had reached a new multi-year carriage agreement with Dish Network,[39]\n\nthe financial terms of which were not disclosed. Despite the earlier announcement that The Weather Channel would be dropped, the channel was never officially removed from Dish Network. The Weather Cast ceased operations in anticipation of the launch of a Weatherscan\n-based service announced as part of the agreement that would provide local weather information for Dish Network customers. The proposed movie scheduled for the Friday after the deal was struck (May 28), Gorillas in the Mist\n\n, was dropped in favor of a six-hour marathon of Tornado Road\n.","DirecTV\nremoved The Weather Channel from its lineup at 12:00\u0026#160;a.m. Eastern Time on January 14, 2014, after the two parties were unable to come to terms on a new carriage agreement;[40]\n\nas a result, DirecTV became the first major pay television provider to drop the channel in its history.[41]\n\nTwo weeks before the channel's carriage agreement was set to expire on December 31 (after which the deadline for a new carriage deal was extended by two weeks), the satellite provider began carrying WeatherNation TV\n(the successor to The Weather Cast and owned by WeatherNation, LLC) on channel 361 on December 16, 2013 – placing the channel next to The Weather Channel's slot on channel 362;[42]\n\nWeatherNation replaced The Weather Channel on channel 362 – while still being carried on channel 361 – when TWC was pulled.[41]\n\n[43]\n\n","The Weather Channel's chief executive officer David Kenny stated that it offered DirecTV the best rate for its programming (according to SNL Kagan\n, The Weather Channel's average carriage fee at the time was 13¢ per subscriber), and blasted the satellite provider's removal of the channel by stating that it was putting profits ahead of public safety.[40]\n\nRepresentatives for DirecTV stated that it added WeatherNation TV in response to subscriber complaints regarding the number of reality programs on The Weather Channel, which it estimated had amounted to 40% of its daily schedule[41]\n\n[43]\n\n(WeatherNation TV, which outside of its carriage by DirecTV is primarily carried on broadcast television\nstations as a main channel affiliation or a digital multicast service\n, does not run programming outside of forecasts with the only interruption in its weather coverage coming from affiliates that carry children's programs to fulfill FCC\neducational programming\nrequirements; however, WeatherNation has been criticized for its absence of live programming, which TWC does provide, especially during significant weather events[44]\n\n). DirecTV stated that weather information is also available through broadcast television stations carried as part of its local channel tier, as well as the provider's designated emergency channels.[43]\n\nThe Weather Channel fought back by airing commercials encouraging people to not subscribe to DirecTV by parodying the provider's popular \"When You...\" ad campaign, which is this:","style=\"width: 20px; vertical-align: bottom; border: none; color: #B2B7F2; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: .6em; text-align: right; padding: 10px 10px;\"\u003e”","On April 8, 2014, The Weather Channel and DirecTV both settled on a new agreement (TWC decided to alter its programming lineup by trimming the amount of reality programming on weekdays in half, restricting them to its nighttime schedule, in response to complaints from DirecTV subscribers), with the provider restoring the channel on channel 362 the following day. Access to local weather content using the red button feature did not return until May 2, 2014.[45]\n\n","Verizon FiOS\ndropped The Weather Channel and its sister network Weatherscan from its lineup at 12:00\u0026#160;a.m. Eastern Time on March 10, 2015, after the two parties were unable to come to terms on a new carriage agreement. The services have respectively been replaced by the AccuWeather Network\n(which launched on March 10) and a widget\nprovided by FiOS featuring forecast content provided by WeatherBug\n. No public announcement was made regarding the removal until over 12 hours after TWC and Weatherscan were pulled.[46]\n\n[47]\n\n[48]\n\nThe Weather Channel offered a less expensive deal to Verizon FiOS, which rejected the offer. Verizon cited the wide availability of the internet and mobile apps for consumers to access weather content any time of day as the reason for dropping TWC and its services.[49]\n\n[50]\n\nIt is unknown if Frontier FiOS\ncustomers in clusters formerly served by Verizon are affected, including (as of April 1, 2016) the recently acquired clusters from California, Texas, and Florida.","A representative for the network said in a statement, \"We were disappointed when, without warning late yesterday, March 9, Verizon FiOS dropped The Weather Channel from their lineup while our companies continued to be in active conversations regarding a contract renewal. FiOS customers have enjoyed a bundle of services from The Weather Channel including the network, Weatherscan, On-Demand, a Weather Widget and streaming on mobile devices. During a winter with record-breaking storms and severe weather, The Weather Channel responded with non-stop live coverage, including the ongoing presence of our crews reporting live from hard-hit communities within the Verizon FiOS footprint. This coverage resulted in The Weather Channel being the only major cable network to grow in February.\"","The Weather Channel had earlier signed renewal agreements with major providers that are members of the National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC), including Time Warner Cable\nand Cox Communications\n. However, representatives for the channel were shocked that \"Verizon FiOS would deny their subscribers access to the best live weather coverage and expertise that only The Weather Channel can provide.\" While Verizon claimed it was a long-term business decision (instead of a carriage dispute) that it made, The Weather Channel launched a campaign, originally urging viewers to contact FiOS about restoring the cable channel and its services. But, seeing that Verizon is not planning on bringing the channel and its services back in the near future, The Weather Channel now urges its viewers to switch providers.[51]\n\n","\n","In the fall of 2012, The Weather Channel began to assign names to major winter storm systems. The channel's management stated the decision to start naming notable winter storms came as a way to more easily spread knowledge and raise awareness. By naming winter storms, TWC stated that the public would find it easier to follow storm information, social media will be able to refer to and discuss the storm, and people will have an easier time referring to the storm after it occurs.[52]\n\nMost independent sources identify the use of winter storm names by The Weather Channel as a form of search engine optimization\n-friendly branding.[53]\n\n","The first winter storm to be named by TWC was a ki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States\" title=\"East Coast of the United States\"\u003eEast Coast of the United States\nin ter\" title=\"November 2012 nor'easter\"\u003eNovember 2012\n, which was named after the Greek goddess Athena\n.

Multiple factors are taken into consideration when deciding whether to name a winter storm. This includes, but is not limited to, predicted snowfall and other precipitation, wind speeds, and the timing of the storm.[52]\n\n\nThe Weather Channel has provided the reasoning behind their decision to name certain storms, in particular Athena,[55]\n\nBrutus,[56]\n\nGandolf,[57]\n\nIago,[58]\n\nKhan,[59]\n\nLuna,[60]\n\nMagnus,[61]\n\nNemo,[62]\n\nSaturn,[63]\n\nand Virgil.[64]\n\n\nIn response, the National Weather Service\nannounced on November 7, 2012, that it would not recognize The Weather Channel’s names for winter storms, stating in a press release that it \"does not use the name of winter storms in its products.\"[65]\n\n[66]\n\n[67]\n\nSimilarly, references to the names are generally limited on TWC-provided forecasts seen on NBC's news programs\n.\nIn popular culture\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nThe film Back to the Future Part II\n\nhas a futuristic version of The Weather Channel that looks similar to the present day logo in the year 2015 (but centered, in Italic and without the blue box and with the planet Earth\n).\nIn the film The Day After Tomorrow\n\n, The Weather Channel shows a tornado warning\nfor Los Angeles.\nIn the film Home Alone 3\n\n, The Weather Channel shows a forecast for Chicago while a kid is watching The Weather Channel.\nIn the Season 9 finale of the sitcom Friends\n\n, Rachel Green\n(played by Jennifer Aniston\n) tunes into The Weather Channel in her hotel room in Barbados\n, as TWC on-camera meteorologist Alexandra Steele says it is sunny in New York City\n(the regular setting for the series); Rachel, as a result, frustratedly calls her a \"weather bitch\".\nThe Weather Channel was featured in the film Sharknado 2: The Second One\n\n, which aired on sister property (through NBCUniversal) Syfy\n.\nThe Weather Channel was mentioned on a Ziggy\n\ncomic for November 25, 2015.\n\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nWeather portal\n\n\n\n\nWeather media in the United States\n\nThe Weather Network\n– A Canadian Category A\ncable and satellite channel devoted to weather forecasts.\nWeatherStar\n– A series of proprietary computer units installed at the head end of cable television providers that disseminate weather data.\nThe Weather Company\n– The former parent company of The Weather Channel.\n\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n^ a\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n\nd\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\"IBM Finalizes Deal for Weather Channel Product and Tech Business\"\n.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df080262df3aa1b2f56d"},"content":{"contents":["The February 2010 Australian cyberattacks\nwere a series of denial-of-service attacks\nconducted by the Anonymous\nonline community against the Australian government\nin response to proposed web censorship\nregulations. Operation Titstorm\nwas the name given to the cyber attacks\nby the perpetrators. They resulted in lapses of access to government websites on 10 and 11 February 2010. This was accompanied by emails, faxes, and phone calls harassing government offices. The actual size of the attack and number of perpetrators involved is unknown but it was estimated that the number of systems involved ranged from the hundreds to the thousands. The amount of traffic caused disruption on multiple government websites.","Australian Telecommunications Minister Stephen Conroy\nproposed the regulations that would mainly filter sites with pornographic content\n. Various groups advocating uncensored access to the Internet, along with companies like Google\nand Yahoo!\n, object to the proposed filter. A spokesperson for Conroy said that the actions were not a legitimate form of protest and called it irresponsible. The attacks also drew criticism from other filter protest groups. The initial stage was followed by small in-person protests on 20 February that were called \"Project Freeweb\n\".","","","The attack began as a protest responding to a plan by Australian Telecommunications Minister Stephen Conroy\nthat would require internet service providers\nto block Australian users from accessing illegal and what the government deemed as \"unwanted\" content.[1]\n\nWebsites to be blocked feature pornography showing rape, bestiality\n, child sex abuse\n, small-breasted women (who may appear under the legal age), and female ejaculation\n. Drawn depictions of such acts\nare included in the proposal.[2]\n\nThe proposed filter also includes gambling sites along with others showing drug use.[3]\n\nA leaked version of the proposed blacklist (also referred to as the \"refused classification\" or \"RC\" list) also showed sites that did not include adult content. The name \"Operation Titstorm\" was in reference to the material that would be censored.[4]\n\n","Google\nhas questioned the proposal, saying the prohibitions would be too broad.[1]\n\n[4]\n\nIt is strongly opposed by free speech\ngroups. A poll conducted by McNair Ingenuity Research for the Hungry Beast\n\ntelevision program found that 80% of their 1,000 respondents were in favour of the concept of the plan.[5]\n\nThe survey also found that 91% were concerned about the government's intent to keep the list of filtered websites a secret.[6]\n\n","The Department of Defence\n's Cyber Security Operations Centre discovered the attack was coming on 5 February.[7]\n\nA statement released by Anonymous to the press two days before the attack said, \"No government should have the right to refuse its citizens access to information solely because they perceive it to be 'unwanted'.\" It went on to read, \"The Australian Government will learn that one does not mess with our porn. No one messes with our access to perfectly legal (or illegal) content for any reason\".[8]\n\n[9]\n\nAnonymous had previously garnered media attention with protests against Church of Scientology\n(Project Chanology\n) and the Iranian government.[10]\n\nIn September 2009, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd\n's website was hacked in a similar protest to proposed web censorship reforms.[5]\n\n","Flyers distributed to recruit participants said the attack was to begin at 8\u0026#160;pm\u0026#160;AEST on 10 February.[9]\n\nOn that day, government websites were targeted by denial-of-service attacks\n. The Communications Department said the hackers had not infiltrated government security, but had instead swamped government computer servers.[5]\n\nSites were left unavailable for sporadic periods throughout the attack. At one point, the Australian Parliament's website was offline for about two days due to the high volume of requests.[11]\n\nRudd's government site was also inaccessible for some time. As a primary target, the Communications Department also received a large amount of traffic. Government offices were also flooded with e-mail spam\n, junk faxes\n, and prank phone calls\n.[2]\n\nThe Prime Minister's homepage was vandalized with pornographic images.[8]\n\nThe flyer released before the attack called for the faxes to focus on cartoon pornography, female ejaculation, and small-breasted pornography.[12]\n\n[13]\n\n","Reports of the actual size of the attack have varied. One cyber security expert described the attacks as \"the equivalent of parking a truck across the driveway of a shopping centre\".[14]\n\nA firm marketing security technology said that the peak of the attack was a relatively low 16.84 megabits\nper second.[2]\n\nOne writer described the 7.5 million requests per second that initially brought down the Parliament website as \"massive\".[1]\n\nThe site usually only receives a few hundred per second.[9]\n\nIt appears that botnets\nmade up of compromised computers were not used.[2]\n\nEstimates of the number of attacking systems involved have ranged from hundreds to thousands.[3]\n\n[10]\n\n","A spokeswoman for Conroy said such attacks were not a legitimate political protest. According to her, they were \"totally irresponsible and potentially deny services to the Australian public\".[15]\n\nThe Systems Administrators Guild of Australia\nsaid that it \"condemned DDoS attacks as the wrong way to express disagreement with the proposed law\".[16]\n\nAnti-censorship groups criticised the attacks, saying they hurt their cause.[10]\n\n[15]\n\nA purported spokesperson for the attackers recommended that the wider Australian public protest the filter by signing the petition of Electronic Frontiers Australia\n.[17]\n\n","Anonymous coordinated a second phase with small protests outside the Parliament House in Canberra\nand in major cities throughout Australia on 20 February. Additional demonstrations were held at some of the country's embassies\noverseas.[16]\n\nThe organizers called the follow-up protests \"Project Freeweb\" to differentiate them from the criticised cyber attacks.[18]\n\n","Several supporters of the attack later said on a messageboard that taking down websites was not enough to convince the government to back down on the web filtering policy and called for violence. Others disagreed with such actions and proposed launching an additional attack on a popular government site. A spokesman for Electronic Frontiers Australia said he believed there was no real intention or capacity to follow through with any of the violent threats.[19]\n\n","The attack also resulted in criticism of Australia's terrorism laws from The University of New South Wales Law Journal\n.[20]\n\nOne writer wrote that the provisions leave \"no place for legitimate acts of online protest, or at least sets the penalty far too high for relatively minor cyber-vandalism\".[21]\n\n","An Australian teenager was charged with four counts of inciting other hackers to impair electronic communications and two of unauthorised access to restricted data for his role in the attack. He was ordered to pay a bond instead of being convicted after pleading guilty and showing good behaviour.[22]\n\n","In July 2010, Conroy delayed implementing the plan pending a 12-month review into how refused classification content was rated. The proposal is not expected to go forward due to the opposition from The Coalition\nand the Greens\n. Internet service providers Telstra\nand Optus\nhave both agreed to voluntarily block some content.[23]\n\n"],"title":"February 2010 Australian cyberattacks","rels":["/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Australia","/wiki/Operation_Payback","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Operation_Aurora","/wiki/Operation_Payback","/wiki/DigiNotar","/wiki/HBGary","/wiki/Operation_AntiSec","/wiki/Operation_Tunisia","/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage","/wiki/RSA_SecurID#March_2011_system_compromise","/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack","/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak","/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack","/wiki/Snapchat#December_2013_hack","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#August_2013_breach","/wiki/Anthem_medical_data_breach","/wiki/Operation_Tovar","/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos","/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack","/wiki/2014_Russian_hacker_password_theft","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach","/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach","/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach","/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach","/wiki/VTech#2015_data_breach","/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack","/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery","/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center#Ransomware","/wiki/Commission_on_Elections_data_breach","/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack","/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/2017_Westminster_cyberattack","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/2017_cyberattacks_on_Ukraine","/wiki/Equifax#May–July_2017_data_breach","/wiki/Deloitte#2016–17_email_hack","/wiki/Disqus#October_2017_security_breach","/wiki/Anonymous_(group)","/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous","/wiki/Bureau_121","/wiki/Cozy_Bear","/wiki/CyberBerkut","/wiki/Derp_(hacker_group)","/wiki/Equation_Group","/wiki/Fancy_Bear","/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America","/wiki/Goatse_Security","/wiki/Guccifer_2.0","/wiki/Hacking_Team","/wiki/Iranian_Cyber_Army","/wiki/Lizard_Squad","/wiki/LulzRaft","/wiki/LulzSec","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack#Perpetrators","/wiki/NullCrew","/wiki/NSO_Group","/wiki/PayPal_14","/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398","/wiki/PLATINUM_(cybercrime_group)","/wiki/Pranknet","/wiki/RedHack","/wiki/Rocket_Kitten","/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers","/wiki/Syrian_Electronic_Army","/wiki/TeaMp0isoN","/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations","/wiki/UGNazi","/wiki/Yemen_Cyber_Army","/wiki/George_Hotz","/wiki/Guccifer","/wiki/Hector_Monsegur","/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond","/wiki/Junaid_Hussain","/wiki/Kristoffer_von_Hassel","/wiki/Mustafa_Al-Bassam","/wiki/MLT_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Ryan_Ackroyd","/wiki/Topiary_(hacktivist)","/wiki/The_Jester_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Weev","/wiki/Evercookie","/wiki/ISeeYou","/wiki/Heartbleed","/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)","/wiki/POODLE","/wiki/Rootpipe","/wiki/Row_hammer","/wiki/JASBUG","/wiki/Stagefright_(bug)","/wiki/DROWN_attack","/wiki/Badlock","/wiki/Dirty_COW","/wiki/Cloudbleed","/wiki/Broadcom#Vulnerabilities","/wiki/EternalBlue","/wiki/DoublePulsar","/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology#Silent_Bob_is_Silent","/wiki/KRACK","/wiki/ROCA_vulnerability","/wiki/BlueBorne_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Ransomware#Bad_Rabbit","/wiki/Careto_(malware)","/wiki/CryptoLocker","/wiki/Dexter_(malware)","/wiki/Duqu","/wiki/Duqu_2.0","/wiki/FinFisher","/wiki/Flame_(malware)","/wiki/Gameover_ZeuS","/wiki/Mahdi_(malware)","/wiki/Metulji_botnet","/wiki/Mirai_(malware)","/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog","/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club#Staatstrojaner_affair","/wiki/Shamoon","/wiki/Stars_virus","/wiki/Stuxnet","/wiki/Vault_7","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/X-Agent","/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_mask","/wiki/Imageboard","/wiki/Internet_vigilantism","/wiki/Low_Orbit_Ion_Cannon","/wiki/4chan","/wiki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica","/wiki/WikiLeaks","/wiki/Ghost_Security","/wiki/LulzSec","/wiki/MalSec","/wiki/RedHack","/wiki/February_2010_Australian_Cyberattacks","/wiki/Habbo#Habbo_raids","/wiki/Operation_AntiSec","/wiki/Operation_Leakspin","/wiki/Operation_Payback","/wiki/Operation_Tunisia","/wiki/Project_Chanology","/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous","/wiki/February_2010_Australian_cyberattacks","/wiki/February_2010_Australian_cyberattacks"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/February_2010_Australian_cyberattacks"}

According to media reports, Yahoo\n, Symantec\n, Northrop Grumman\n, Morgan Stanley\n[7]\n\nand Dow Chemical\n[8]\n\nwere also among the targets.","As a result of the attack, Google stated in its blog that it plans to operate a completely uncensored\nversion of its search engine in China \"within the law, if at all\", and acknowledged that if this is not possible it may leave China and close its Chinese offices.[1]\n\nOfficial Chinese sources claimed this was part of a strategy developed by the U.S. government.[9]\n\n","The attack was named \"Operation Aurora\" by Dmitri Alperovitch\n, Vice President of Threat Research at cyber security company McAfee\n. Research by McAfee Labs discovered that \"Aurora\" was part of the file path\non the attacker's machine that was included in two of the malware\nbinaries\nMcAfee said were associated with the attack. \"We believe the name was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation,\" McAfee Chief Technology Officer George Kurtz said in a blog post.[10]\n\n","According to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially modify source code\nrepositories at these high tech, security and defense contractor companies. \"[The SCMs\n] were wide open,\" says Alperovitch. \"No one ever thought about securing them, yet these were the crown jewels of most of these companies in many ways—much more valuable than any financial or personally identifiable data that they may have and spend so much time and effort protecting.\"[11]\n\n","","","On January 12, 2010, Google revealed on its blog that it had been the victim of a cyber attack. The company said the attack occurred in mid-December and originated from China. Google stated that over 20 other companies had been attacked; other sources have since cited that more than 34 organizations were targeted.[8]\n\nAs a result of the attack, Google said it was reviewing its business in China.[1]\n\nOn the same day, United States Secretary of State\nHillary Clinton\nissued a brief statement condemning the attacks and requesting a response from China.[12]\n\n","On January 13, 2010, the news agency\nAll Headline News\nreported that the United States Congress\nplans to investigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service to spy on human rights activists.[13]\n\n","In Beijing\n, visitors left flowers outside of Google's office. However, these were later removed, with a Chinese security guard stating that this was an \"illegal flower tribute\".[14]\n\nThe Chinese government has yet to issue a formal response, although an anonymous official stated that China is seeking more information on Google's intentions.[15]\n\n","Technical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other factors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack, one of numerous attacks conducted by the Elderwood gang and others such as PLA Unit 61398\n, a Shanghai\n-based advanced persistent threat\ngroup also called \"Comment Crew\", named after the technique often used by the group involving internal software \"comment\" features on web pages, which are used to infiltrate target computers that access the sites. The two largest groups may employ hundreds of people, and work to compromise security and siphon business ideas, advanced designs, and trade secrets from various foreign computer networks.[16]\n\nThe group behind the Operation Aurora attacks were dubbed \"Elderwood\" by Symantec\nafter a source-code variable used by the attackers, and \"Beijing Group\" by Dell Secureworks\n. The group obtained some of Google's source code, as well as access to information about Chinese activists.[17]\n\nAlong with other groups such as Unit 61398, also targeted numerous other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors.[2]\n\n[18]\n\n","Elderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers that make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies. Those firms then become a cyber \"stepping stone\" to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. One attack procedure used by Elderwood is to infect legitimate websites frequented by employees of the target company – a so-called \"water hole\" attack, just as lions stake out a watering hole for their prey. Elderwood infects these less-secure sites with malware that downloads to a computer that clicks on the site. After that, the group searches inside the network to which the infected computer is connected, finding and then downloading executives' e-mails and critical documents on company plans, decisions, acquisitions, and product designs.[2]\n\n","In its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property\nhad been stolen. It suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail\naccounts of Chinese dissidents\n. According to the Financial Times\n\n, two accounts used by Ai Weiwei\nhad been attacked, their contents read and copied; his bank accounts were investigated by state security agents who claimed he was under investigation for \"unspecified suspected crimes\".[19]\n\nHowever, the attackers were only able to view details on two accounts and those details were limited to things such as the subject line and the accounts' creation date.[1]\n\n","Security experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack.[10]\n\nTwo days after the attack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zero-day\nvulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in Internet Explorer\nand dubbed the attack \"Operation Aurora\". A week after the report by McAfee, Microsoft\nissued a fix for the issue,[20]\n\nand admitted that they had known about the security hole used since September.[21]\n\nAdditional vulnerabilities were found in Perforce\n, the source code revision software used by Google to manage their source code.[22]\n\n[23]\n\n","VeriSign\n's iDefense Labs claimed that the attacks were perpetrated by \"agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof\".[24]\n\n","According to a diplomatic cable\nfrom the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source reported that the Chinese Politburo\ndirected the intrusion into Google's computer systems. The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed by \"government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government.\"[25]\n\nThe report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in which attackers have \"broken into American government\ncomputers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama\nand American businesses since 2002.\"[26]\n\nAccording to The Guardian\n's reporting on the leak, the attacks were \"orchestrated by a senior member of the Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and found articles criticising him personally.\"[27]\n\n","Once a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an SSL\nconnection made connections to command and control\nservers running in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace\ncustomer accounts. The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate intranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories\n.","The attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and control servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the attackers intentionally shut them down.[28]\n\nHowever, the attacks were still occurring as of February 2010.[3]\n\n","The German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of Internet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until a fix for the security hole was made.[29]\n\n[30]\n\n[31]\n\nThe German, Australian, and French governments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially vulnerable.[32]\n\n[33]\n\n","In an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.[34]\n\n","The Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework\npenetration testing tool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing web-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability,\" said George Kurtz, CTO of McAfee, of the attack. \"The now public computer code may help cyber criminals craft attacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems.\"[35]\n\n","Security company Websense\nsaid it identified \"limited public use\" of the unpatched IE vulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites.[36]\n\nAccording to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went public last week. \"Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to the public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the possibility of widespread attacks,\" said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee, in a blog update\n.[37]\n\nConfirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified additional sites using the exploit on January 19.[38]\n\nAccording to reports from Ahnlab, the second URL was spread through the Instant Messenger network Misslee Messenger, a popular IM client in South Korea.[38]\n\n","Researchers have created attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and IE8—even when Microsoft's recommended defensive measure (Data Execution Prevention\n(DEP)) is turned on.[dubious\n\n– discuss\n\n\n]\nAccording to Dino Dai Zovi, a security vulnerability researcher, \"even the newest IE8 isn't safe from attack if it's running on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or earlier, or on Windows Vista RTM (release to manufacturing), the version Microsoft shipped in January 2007.\"[39]\n\n","Microsoft admitted that the security hole used had been known to them since September.[21]\n\nWork on an update was prioritized[40]\n\nand on Thursday, January 21, 2010, Microsoft released a security patch aiming to counter this weakness, the published exploits based on it and a number of other privately reported vulnerabilities.[41]\n\nThey did not state if any of the latter had been used or published by exploiters or whether these had any particular relation to the Aurora operation, but the entire cumulative update was termed critical for most versions of Windows, including Windows 7.","Security researchers continued to investigate the attacks. HBGary\n, a security firm, released a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that might help identify the code developer. The firm also said that the code was Chinese language based but could not be specifically tied to any government entity.[42]\n\n","On February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has claimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks made on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years. They have also tracked the attack back to its point of origin, which seems to be two Chinese schools, Shanghai Jiao Tong University\nand Lanxiang Vocational School\n.[43]\n\nAs highlighted by The New York Times\n, both of these schools have ties with the Chinese search engine Baidu\n, a rival of Google China\n.[44]\n\nBoth Lanxiang Vocational and Jiaotong University have denied the allegation.[45]\n\n[46]\n\n","In March 2010, Symantec\n, which was helping investigate the attack for Google, identified Shaoxing\nas the source of 21.3% of all (12 billion) malicious emails sent throughout the world.[47]\n\n","To prevent future cyberattacks such as Operation Aurora, Amitai Etzioni\nof the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies has suggested that the United States and China agree to a policy of mutually assured restraint with respect to cyberspace. This would involve allowing both states to take the measures they deem necessary for their self-defense while simultaneously agreeing to refrain from taking offensive steps; it would also entail vetting these commitments.[48]\n\n"],"title":"Operation Aurora","rels":["/wiki/Google","/wiki/Honker_Union","/wiki/Cyber-warfare","/wiki/Titan_Rain","/wiki/Chinese_intelligence_activity_in_other_countries","/wiki/GhostNet","/wiki/Industrial_espionage","/wiki/Chinese_Intelligence_Operations_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Vulcanbot","/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Foundstone","/wiki/Stonesoft_Corporation","/wiki/McAfee_SiteAdvisor","/wiki/McAfee_VirusScan","/wiki/Validate_(McAfee)","/wiki/John_McAfee","/wiki/Intel","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/February_2010_Australian_cyberattacks","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Operation_Payback","/wiki/DigiNotar","/wiki/HBGary","/wiki/Operation_AntiSec","/wiki/Operation_Tunisia","/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage","/wiki/RSA_SecurID#March_2011_system_compromise","/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack","/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak","/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack","/wiki/Snapchat#December_2013_hack","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#August_2013_breach","/wiki/Anthem_medical_data_breach","/wiki/Operation_Tovar","/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos","/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack","/wiki/2014_Russian_hacker_password_theft","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach","/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach","/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach","/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach","/wiki/VTech#2015_data_breach","/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack","/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery","/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center#Ransomware","/wiki/Commission_on_Elections_data_breach","/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack","/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/2017_Westminster_cyberattack","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/2017_cyberattacks_on_Ukraine","/wiki/Equifax#May–July_2017_data_breach","/wiki/Deloitte#2016–17_email_hack","/wiki/Disqus#October_2017_security_breach","/wiki/Anonymous_(group)","/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous","/wiki/Bureau_121","/wiki/Cozy_Bear","/wiki/CyberBerkut","/wiki/Derp_(hacker_group)","/wiki/Equation_Group","/wiki/Fancy_Bear","/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America","/wiki/Goatse_Security","/wiki/Guccifer_2.0","/wiki/Hacking_Team","/wiki/Iranian_Cyber_Army","/wiki/Lizard_Squad","/wiki/LulzRaft","/wiki/LulzSec","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack#Perpetrators","/wiki/NullCrew","/wiki/NSO_Group","/wiki/PayPal_14","/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398","/wiki/PLATINUM_(cybercrime_group)","/wiki/Pranknet","/wiki/RedHack","/wiki/Rocket_Kitten","/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers","/wiki/Syrian_Electronic_Army","/wiki/TeaMp0isoN","/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations","/wiki/UGNazi","/wiki/Yemen_Cyber_Army","/wiki/George_Hotz","/wiki/Guccifer","/wiki/Hector_Monsegur","/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond","/wiki/Junaid_Hussain","/wiki/Kristoffer_von_Hassel","/wiki/Mustafa_Al-Bassam","/wiki/MLT_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Ryan_Ackroyd","/wiki/Topiary_(hacktivist)","/wiki/The_Jester_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Weev","/wiki/Evercookie","/wiki/ISeeYou","/wiki/Heartbleed","/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)","/wiki/POODLE","/wiki/Rootpipe","/wiki/Row_hammer","/wiki/JASBUG","/wiki/Stagefright_(bug)","/wiki/DROWN_attack","/wiki/Badlock","/wiki/Dirty_COW","/wiki/Cloudbleed","/wiki/Broadcom#Vulnerabilities","/wiki/EternalBlue","/wiki/DoublePulsar","/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology#Silent_Bob_is_Silent","/wiki/KRACK","/wiki/ROCA_vulnerability","/wiki/BlueBorne_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Ransomware#Bad_Rabbit","/wiki/Careto_(malware)","/wiki/CryptoLocker","/wiki/Dexter_(malware)","/wiki/Duqu","/wiki/Duqu_2.0","/wiki/FinFisher","/wiki/Flame_(malware)","/wiki/Gameover_ZeuS","/wiki/Mahdi_(malware)","/wiki/Metulji_botnet","/wiki/Mirai_(malware)","/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog","/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club#Staatstrojaner_affair","/wiki/Shamoon","/wiki/Stars_virus","/wiki/Stuxnet","/wiki/Vault_7","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/X-Agent","/wiki/Operation_Aurora","/wiki/Operation_Aurora"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Operation_Aurora"}

Operation Payback started as retaliation to distributed denial of service\n(DDoS) attacks on torrent\nsites; piracy proponents then decided to launch DDoS attacks on piracy opponents. The initial reaction snowballed into a wave of attacks on major pro-copyright and anti-piracy organizations, law firms, and individuals.","Following the United States diplomatic cables leak\nin December 2010, the organizers commenced DDoS attacks on websites of banks who had withdrawn banking facilities from WikiLeaks\n.","","","In 2010, several Bollywood\ncompanies hired Aiplex Software\nto launch DDoS attacks on websites that did not respond to takedown notices\n.[4]\n\n[5]\n\nPiracy activists then created Operation Payback in September 2010 in retaliation.[4]\n\nThe original plan was to attack Aiplex Software directly, but upon finding some hours before the planned DDoS that another individual had taken down the firm's website on their own, Operation Payback moved to launching attacks against the websites of copyright stringent organisations Motion Picture Association of America\n(MPAA) and International Federation of the Phonographic Industry\n, giving the two websites a combined total downtime of 30 hours.[6]\n\n[7]\n\nIn the following two days, Operation Payback attacked a multitude of sites affiliated with the MPAA, the Recording Industry Association of America\n(RIAA),[8]\n\nand British Phonographic Industry\n.[4]\n\nLaw firms such as ACS:Law\n, Davenport Lyons\nand Dunlap, Grubb \u0026amp; Weaver (of the US Copyright Group\n) were also attacked.[9]\n\n[10]\n\n[11]\n\n[12]\n\n","On September 21, 2010, the website of United Kingdom law firm ACS:Law\nwas subjected to a DDoS attack as part of Operation Payback. When asked about the attacks, Andrew Crossley, owner of ACS:Law, said: \"It was only down for a few hours. I have far more concern over the fact of my train turning up 10 minutes late or having to queue for a coffee than them wasting my time with this sort of rubbish.\"[9]\n\n[11]\n\n","When the site came back online a 350MB\nfile, which was a backup of the site, was visible to anyone for a short period of time.[13]\n\nThe backup, which included copies of emails sent by the firm, was downloaded and made available onto various peer-to-peer\nnetworks and websites including The Pirate Bay\n.[13]\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\nSome of the emails contained unencrypted Excel\nspreadsheets, listing the names and addresses of people that ACS:Law had accused of illegally sharing media. One contained more than 5,300 Sky broadband\ncustomers whom they had accused of illegally sharing pornography\n,[16]\n\n[17]\n\nwhile another contained the details of 8,000 Sky customers and 400 Plusnet\ncustomers accused of infringing the copyright on music by sharing it on peer-to-peer networks\n.[18]\n\nThis alleged breach of the Data Protection Act\nhas become part of the ongoing investigation into ACS:Law by the 27s_Office\" title=\"Information Commissioner's Office\"\u003eInformation Commissioner's Office\n.[19]\n\n[20]\n\n","On September 30, the Leesburg, Virginia\noffice of Dunlap, Grubb \u0026amp; Weaver law firm – also doing business as the \"U.S. Copyright Group\n\"[21]\n\n– was evacuated by the police after an emailed bomb threat was received.[22]\n\n[23]\n\nIt's believed the event could be connected to Anonymous.[24]\n\nNon-related copyright or law firms sites, such as websheriff.com,[12]\n\nwere also attacked. These attacks were originally organized through an Internet Relay Chat\nchannel.[4]\n\nThe attacks also became a popular topic on Twitter\n.[4]\n\n","On September 27, 2010, the DDoS attack on the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft\n(AFACT) unintentionally brought down 8,000 other small websites hosted on the same server.[25]\n\n","In September 2010, in an attempt to ensure that Portuguese\ncitizens can’t access thepiratebay.org\n, Associação do Comércio Audiovisual de Portugal (ACAPOR) filed a complaint against The Pirate Bay\n. The complaint was filed with the General Inspection of Cultural Activities, which is part of the Portuguese Ministry of Culture\n. According to the movie rental association, The Pirate Bay is directly responsible for about 15 million illegal downloads in Portugal every year. By installing a Pirate Bay block on all ISPs\n, ACAPOR hoped to decrease the financial damage it claims The Pirate Bay causes.[26]\n\n","On October 18, 2010, the ACAPOR website was defaced\n, presenting text from Operation Payback and a redirect to The Pirate Bay after a few seconds. In addition to defacing the website, a copy of the email database of ACAPOR was uploaded to The Pirate Bay.[27]\n\n[28]\n\nThe leaked e-mails so far revealed ACAPOR's methods of denunciation, its dissatisfaction with the Portuguese government and justice system,[29]\n\nits perception of the copyright debate as war, and its antagonism with the ISPs. ACAPOR claimed that \"the business of ISPs is illegal downloading.\"[30]\n\n","On October 4, 2010, Operation Payback launched an attack on the Ministry of Sound\nwebsite and the Gallant Macmillan website.[31]\n\n","On October 7, 2010, they attacked the website of the Spanish copyright society, sgae.es.[32]\n\nAs of October 7, 2010, the total downtime for all websites attacked during Operation Payback was 537.55 hours.[7]\n\n","On October 15, 2010, Copyprotected.com was SQL injected\nand defaced,[7]\n\n[33]\n\nand three days later Operation Payback launched a DDoS attack against the UK Intellectual Property Office\n.[34]\n\n","Production companies\nSatelFilm.at and Wega-Film.at were hit by \"drive-by\" DDoSes on October 21, 2010, in response to their efforts to gain a court injunction against an ISP\nthat refused to block a movie-streaming website,[35]\n\nOperation Payback then knocked porn website Hustler.com\noffline the following day.[36]\n\n","During the 2010 MIPCOM\nconvention, Gene Simmons\nof KISS\nstated:","In response to Simmons' comments,[38]\n\nmembers of Operation Payback switched their attentions to his two websites, SimmonsRecords.com\nand GeneSimmons.com\n, taking them both offline for a total of 38 hours.[7]\n\n[39]\n\nAt some point during the course of this DDoS, GeneSimmons.com\nwas hacked and redirected to ThePirateBay.org\n,[40]\n\nIn response to the attack Simmons wrote:","Some of you may have heard a few popcorn farts re: our sites being threatened by hackers.","Our legal team and the FBI have been on the case and we have found a few, shall we say \"adventurous\" young people, who feel they are above the law.","And, as stated in my MIPCOM speech, we will sue their pants off.","First, they will be punished.","We will soon be printing their names and pictures.","We will find you.","You cannot hide.","Stay tuned[41]\n\n","This led to additional attacks and subsequently more downtime for his websites.[41]\n\n[42]\n\n[43]\n\n[44]\n\nLater, Simmons's message was removed from his website.[45]\n\nMore than one year later, in December 2011, a person supposedly known under the nickname \"spydr101\" was arrested in relation to the attack against GeneSimmons.com. He was charged with conspiracy and unauthorized impairment of a protected computer.[46]\n\n[47]\n\n[48]\n\n","On October 26, 2010, LimeWire\nwas ordered to disable the \"searching, downloading, uploading, file trading and/or file distribution functionality\" after losing a court battle with the RIAA\nover claims of copyright infringement. Not satisfied with the injunction, the RIAA announced its intention to continue the Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC\n\ntrial to recover damages caused by the program.[49]\n\n[50]\n\nIn retaliation,[51]\n\nmembers of Operation Payback announced that they would attack RIAA's website on October 29, despite the fact that the group typically does not hit the same target twice.[52]\n\n[53]\n\nOn October 29, riaa.org\nindeed was taken offline via denial-of-service attack\n.[54]\n\n[55]\n\nAfter the attack, riaa.com\nand riaa.org\nsites were inaccessible in Europe.[56]\n\nOperation Payback's main site was attacked later that day, and they subsequently moved their website from tieve.tk\nto anonops.net\n.[57]\n\n[58]\n\n","During the damages phase of the LimeWire trial, the RIAA attempted to switch from seeking statutory damages per-work to seeking them per-infringement, but did not quote a total damage amount, nor a method of calculating the number of infringements.[59]\n\nThe judge in the case rejected the proposal, holding that case law only supported statutory damages on a per-work basis for large-scale infringement, thus capping the potential award at $1.5 billion.[59]\n\nOn March 15, 2011, four days after the ruling, a report appeared on Law.com highlighting the judge's remark that the per-infringement award sought by the record companies might total in the \"trillions\"; the report estimated $75 trillion in its attention-grabbing headline (USA's nominal GDP\nin 2012-2013 was about $16–17 trillion).[60]\n\nThis figure was repeated in PC Magazine\n\non March 23.[61]\n\nAn Operation Payback call-to-arms followed, citing the $75 trillion figure as if it were still being actively sought by the RIAA, and a DDoS attack on the RIAA website commenced on March 25.[62]\n\n","Around October 28, 2010, the group set up a new website with the intention of coordinating protests around the world to raise awareness of their cause. The date for the protest activities were on November 5, the intended day of the Gunpowder Plot\n, with which Anonymous heavily affiliates through its use of Guy Fawkes\nmasks.","The protest activity included an attack on the United States Copyright Office\n, after which the FBI\nlaunched an investigation.[63]\n\nThey later arrested one person accused of taking part in the attack on PayPal\n.[64]\n\n","On November 9, 2010, Operation Payback temporarily ceased attacking websites.[65]\n\nThe hiatus lasted about four months, ending with an early March 2011 attack that temporarily took down the website of BMI\n, a prominent collection society operating on behalf of music publishers.[66]\n\nThis was followed by the aforementioned second attack on the RIAA website.","On December 8, 2010, U.S politician Sarah Palin\nannounced that her website and personal credit card information were compromised.[67]\n\nPalin's team believed the attack was executed by Anonymous, though Anonymous never commented about Palin as a possible target for any attack.[67]\n\n[68]\n\n[69]\n\nIn an interview with RT\n, an Anonymous member said, \"We don't really care about Sarah Palin that much, to be honest. I don't really know what she’s trying to accomplish or what attention she is trying to gain. We personally don’t care about Sarah Palin.\"[70]\n\nPalin's technical team posted a screenshot of a server log file showing the wikileaks.org URL\n[67]\n\n[69]\n\nVisa attacks had been denial of service attacks, but credit card data was not compromised. It is unknown whether Palin's card was compromised as part of a broad attack on Visa or a specific attack on the Palins.[69]\n\nPalin's email was previously hacked\n[71]\n\nwhile she was campaigning during the 2008 U.S. presidential election\n.","In December 2010, WikiLeaks\ncame under intense pressure to stop publishing secret U.S. diplomatic cables. Corporations such as Amazon\n, PayPal\n, BankAmerica\n, Swiss bank PostFinance\n, MasterCard\nand Visa\neither stopped working with or froze their customers' donations to WikiLeaks due to political pressures. In response, those behind Operation Payback directed their activities against these companies.[72]\n\n[73]\n\nOperation Payback launched DDoS attacks against PayPal, PostFinance and the Swedish Prosecution Authority\n.[74]\n\n[75]\n\n[76]\n\nOn December 8, 2010, a coordinated DDoS attack by Operation Payback brought down both the MasterCard and Visa websites.[77]\n\n[78]\n\n[79]\n\n[80]\n\nOn December 9, 2010, prior to a sustained DDoS attack on the PayPal website that caused a minor slowdown to its service, PayPal announced on its blog that it would release the frozen funds in the account of the Wau Holland Foundation\nthat was raising funds for WikiLeaks, but would not reactivate the account.[81]\n\n[82]\n\nRegarding the attacks, WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson denied any relation to the group and said, “We neither condemn nor applaud these attacks. We believe they are a reflection of public opinion on the actions of the targets.”[83]\n\nOn the same day, a 16-year-old boy was arrested in The Hague\n, Netherlands\n, in connection with the distributed denial-of-service attacks against MasterCard and PayPal.[84]\n\n[85]\n\n[86]\n\nThe boy was an IRC operator under the nickname of Jeroenz0r.[87]\n\n","On December 10, 2010, The Daily Telegraph\n\nreported that Anonymous had threatened to disrupt British government websites if Assange were extradited to Sweden.[88]\n\nAnonymous issued a press release\n[89]\n\nin an attempt to clarify the issue.[90]\n\n","Electronic Frontier Foundation\nco-founder John Perry Barlow\ndescribed the attacks as \"the shot heard round the world\n—this is Lexington\n.\"[91]\n\n","The following is a list of sites and domains known to have been targeted:","Operation Payback's attempt to take down Amazon.com was aborted after they failed to recruit enough users to their botnet; CNN noted that the massive Amazon website \"is almost impossible to crash.\"[97]\n\n","In late December, the FBI began to raid suspected participants in Operation Payback.[102]\n\n","At the beginning of 2011, Operation Payback brought down Zimbabwean\ngovernment websites after the Zimbabwean President's\nwife\nsued a newspaper for $15 million for publishing a WikiLeaks cable that linked her with the alleged trade in illicit diamonds\n.[103]\n\nOn January 27, 2011, five males aged between 15 and 26 were arrested in early morning raids in the U.K. on suspicion of involvement,[104]\n\nand the FBI executed 40 search warrants the same day.[105]\n\n","The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office\nsaid that when its site was attacked, those responsible were depriving its citizens of access to information they have a democratic right to access.[106]\n\nOther critics claimed the attacks restricted Gene Simmons' right to free speech.[106]\n\n","A spokesman for the MPAA said, \"It's troubling that these groups seem more concerned about the rights of those who steal and copy films, music, books, and other creative resources than the rights of American workers who are producing these products.\" [63]\n\n","There was also some criticism from the Pirate Party UK\nand United States Pirate Party\n, which in a joint public statement urged the group to \"Immediately cease the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and to instead seek out a legal method to express your frustration and disquiet with the copyright industry, and their perversions of copyright law for personal gain.”[107]\n\n","While acknowledging that the DDoS attacks on credit card and banking web sites serve as political protests, cyber experts said that Operation Payback has not done any long-term damage: most sites are back online, these attacks have not penetrated and brought down entire banking systems used to conduct transactions, and people are still continuing to use their credit cards to make payments. \"This is more like a noisy political demonstration, like a mob surrounding a bank and refusing to let anyone in or out\" said one cyber expert.[108]\n\n","Operation Payback members used a modified version of the Low Orbit Ion Cannon\n(LOIC) to execute the DDoS attacks.[109]\n\nIn September 2010, a \"Hive Mind\" mode was added to the LOIC.[109]\n\nWhile in Hive Mind mode, the LOIC connects to IRC\n, where it can be controlled remotely. This allows computers with LOIC installed on them to behave as if they were a part of a botnet\n. Utilising this tool, the coordinators of Operation Payback were able to quickly take down websites belonging to anti-piracy groups.[109]\n\nBotnets of all sizes have also been used.[110]\n\n","Members of Operation Payback reportedly used an IRC\nchannel to communicate about which targets to select, after which \"attack posters\" were produced and posted on various imageboards\n(4chan/7chan/711chan/420chan/808chan).[111]\n\nMedia such as Twitter\nand Facebook\nwere also been utilized for coordination,[111]\n\nbut on December 8, 2010, Operation Payback's Facebook page was removed and its official Twitter account was suspended.[95]\n\n[112]\n\n[113]\n\nAdditionally a federal court order forced Encyclopedia Dramatica\nto delete its Operation Payback article, which featured a detailed history of the operation, including personal information of some individuals associated with the companies attacked .[114]\n\n[115]\n\n[116]\n\n","\n"],"title":"Operation

Firstly, they issued certificates under their own name (where the root CA was \"DigiNotar Root CA\").[11]\n\nEntrust\ncertificates were not issued since July 2010, but some were still valid up to July 2013.[12]\n\n[13]\n\nSecondly, they issued certificates for the Dutch government's PKIoverheid\n(\"PKIgovernment\") program. This issuance was via two intermediate certificates, each of which chained up to one of the two \"Staat der Nederlanden\" root CAs. National and local Dutch authorities and organisations offering services for the government who want to use certificates for secure internet communication can request such a certificate. Some of the most-used electronic services offered by Dutch governments used certificates from DigiNotar. Examples were the authentication infrastructure DigiD\nand the central car-registration organisation Rijksdienst voor het Wegverkeer\n(in Dutch)\n.","DigiNotar's root certificates were removed from the trusted-root lists of all major web browsers and consumer operating systems on or around August 29, 2011;[14]\n\n[15]\n\n[16]\n\nthe \"Staat der Nederlanden\" roots were initially kept because they were not believed to be compromised. However, they have since been revoked.","DigiNotar was originally set up in 1998 by the Dutch notary\nDick Batenburg from Beverwijk\nand the Koninklijke Notariële Beroepsorganisatie\n, the national body for Dutch civil law notaries\n. The KNB offers all kind of central services to the notaries, and because many of the services that notaries offer are official legal procedures, security in communications is important. The KNB offered advisory services to their members on how to implement electronic services in their business; one of these activities was offering secure certificates.","Dick Batenburg and the KNB formed the group TTP Notarissen (TTP Notaries), where TTP stands for trusted third party\n. A notary can become a member of TTP Notarissen if they comply with certain rules. If they comply with additional rules on training and work procedures, they can become an accredited TTP Notary.[17]\n\n","Although DigiNotar had been a general-purpose CA for several years, they still targeted the market for notaries and other professionals.","On January 10, 2011, the company was sold to VASCO Data Security International.[1]\n\nIn a VASCO press release dated June 20, 2011, one day after DigiNotar first detected an incident on their systems[18]\n\nVASCO's president and COO\nJan Valcke is quoted as stating \"We believe that DigiNotar's certificates are among the most reliable in the field.\"[19]\n\n","On September 20, 2011, Vasco announced that its subsidiary DigiNotar was declared bankrupt after filing for voluntary bankruptcy\nat the Haarlem\ncourt\n. Effective immediately the court appointed a receiver\n, a court-appointed trustee who takes over the management of all of DigiNotar’s affairs as it proceeds through the bankruptcy process to liquidation\n.[3]\n\n[20]\n\n","The curator\n\n(court-appointed receiver) didn't want to have the report from ITSec\nto be published, as it might lead to additional claims towards DigiNotar.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nThe report covered the way the company operated and details of the hack of 2011 that lead to its bankruptcy.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","The report was made on request of the Dutch supervisory agency OPTA\nwho refused to publish the report in the first place. In a freedom of information\n(WOB\n\n) procedure started by a journalist, the receiver tried to convince the court not to allow publication of this report, and to confirm the OPTA's initial refusal to do so.[21]\n\n","The report was ordered to be released, and was made public in October 2012. It shows a near total compromise of the systems.","On July 10, 2011, an attacker with access to DigiNotar's systems issued a wildcard\ncertificate\nfor Google\n. This certificate was subsequently used by unknown persons in Iran\nto conduct a man-in-the-middle attack\nagainst Google services.[22]\n\n[23]\n\nOn August 28, 2011, certificate problems were observed on multiple Internet service providers\nin Iran.[24]\n\nThe fraudulent certificate was posted on pastebin\n.[25]\n\nAccording to a subsequent news release by VASCO, DigiNotar had detected an intrusion into its certificate authority infrastructure on July 19, 2011.[26]\n\nDigiNotar did not publicly reveal the security breach at the time.","After this certificate was found, DigiNotar belatedly admitted dozens of fraudulent certificates had been created, including certificates for the domains of Yahoo!\n, Mozilla\n, WordPress\nand The Tor Project\n.[27]\n\nDigiNotar could not guarantee all such certificates had been revoked\n.[28]\n\nGoogle blacklisted\n247 certificates in Chromium\n,[29]\n\nbut the final known total of misissued certificates is at least 531.[30]\n\nInvestigation by F-Secure\nalso revealed that DigiNotar's website had been defaced by Turkish and Iranian hackers in 2009.[31]\n\n","In reaction, Mozilla revoked trust in the DigiNotar root certificate in all supported versions of its Firefox\nbrowser and Microsoft\nremoved the DigiNotar root certificate from its list of trusted certificates with its browsers on all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.[32]\n\n[33]\n\nChromium\n/ Google Chrome\nwas able to detect the fraudulent *.google.com\ncertificate, due to its \"certificate pinning\n\" security feature;[34]\n\nhowever, this protection was limited to Google domains, which resulted in Google removing DigiNotar from its list of trusted certificate issuers.[22]\n\nOpera\nalways checks the certificate revocation list of the certificate's issuer and so they initially stated they did not need a security update.[35]\n\n[36]\n\nHowever, later they also removed the root from their trust store.[37]\n\nOn September 9, 2011, Apple\nissued Security Update 2011-005 for Mac OS X\n10.6.8 and 10.7.1, which removes DigiNotar from the list of trusted root certificates and EV certificate authorities.[38]\n\nWithout this update, Safari\nand Mac OS X do not detect the certificate's revocation, and users must use the Keychain\nutility to manually delete the certificate.[39]\n\nApple did not patch iOS until October 13, 2011 with the release of iOS 5.[40]\n\n","DigiNotar also controlled an intermediate certificate which was used for issuing certificates as part of the Dutch government\n’s public key infrastructure\n\"PKIoverheid\" program, chaining up to the official Dutch government certification authority (Staat der Nederlanden\n).[41]\n\nOnce this intermediate certificate was revoked or marked as untrusted by browsers, the chain of trust\nfor their certificates was broken, and it was difficult to access services such as the identity management\nplatform DigiD\nand the Tax and Customs Administration\n.[42]\n\nGovCert\n, the Dutch computer emergency response team\n, initially did not believe the PKIoverheid certificates had been compromised,[43]\n\nalthough security specialists were uncertain.[28]\n\n[44]\n\nBecause these certificates were initially thought not to be compromised by the security breach, they were, at the request of the Dutch authorities, kept exempt from the removal of trust[41]\n\n[45]\n\n– although one of the two, the active \"Staat der Nederlanden - G2\" root certificate, was overlooked by the Mozilla engineers and accidentally distrusted in the Firefox build.[46]\n\nHowever, this assessment was rescinded after an audit by the Dutch government, and the DigiNotar-controlled intermediates in the \"Staat der Nederlanden\" hierarchy were also blacklisted by Mozilla in the next security update, and also by other browser manufacturers.[47]\n\nThe Dutch government announced on September 3, 2011, that they will switch to a different firm as certificate authority.[48]\n\n","After the initial claim that the certificates under the DigiNotar-controlled intermediate certificate in the PKIoverheid\nhierarchy weren't affected, further investigation by an external party, the Fox-IT consultancy, showed evidence of hacker activity on those machines as well.

It also contained the emails, voicemails\n, chat logs of some of them; in at least one instance it included sexually explicit photographs from one of the officer's girlfriends.[31]\n\nAnonymous also claimed that the documents included officers forwarding racist chain emails, evidence of K-9 unit\nofficers using percocet\n, and a Fraternal Order of Police\nmember who is also a convicted sex offender\n.[31]\n\nAnonymous noted that their motivation stemmed from a desire to make police officers \"experience just a taste of the same kind of violence and terror they dish out on an every day basis.\"[31]\n\n","On the same day, the group released information obtained from various government sources. Government data from Anguilla\n, passwords from servers belonging to the Government of Brazil\n, the users of Zimbabwe\ngovernment websites, and data from the Municipality of Mosman\ncouncil were included.[32]\n\nThe Mosman council dump included mainly publicly available information from the website as well as a not-publicly-available prototype version of the website that had not yet been launched.[33]\n\nThey claimed to also have access to all Zimbabwean government websites ending in gov.zw.[32]\n\nMost of the information and control were given through SQL injection\n.

They also sent a message to company employees urging them to work against the government rather than for it.[48]\n\nThe hack was done with a simple SQL injection\n.[49]\n\n","On 11 July, Anonymous hacked into systems belonging to defense contractor\nBooz Allen Hamilton\n, breaking through barriers that the group described as having \"no security measures in place.\" They released what they said were 90,000 email accounts and encrypted passwords from United States Central Command\n, United States Special Operations Command\n, the United States Marine Corps\n, the United States Air Force\n, the United States Department of Homeland Security\n, United States Department of State\n, and various private sector contractors, calling the released \"Military Meltdown Monday\".[50]\n\n[51]\n\nThey also sarcastically posted an invoice charging the company for \"security audit services rendered\".[51]\n\nDespite Anonymous' claims that 90,000 emails were released, the Associated Press\ncounted only 67,000 unique emails, of which only 53,000 were military addresses. The remainder of the addresses came from educational institutions and defense contractors.[52]\n\nThe Department of Defense said they were aware of the incident and were coordinating with other agencies for a response.[53]\n\nBooz Allen confirmed the intrusion on 13 July, but contradicted Anonymous' claims in saying that the attack never got past their own systems, meaning that information from the military should be secure.[54]\n\n","On 12 July, the group attacked the web servers of agricultural biotechnology\ncompany Monsanto\nand released information on the company's employees, including names, addresses, and email addresses. The group claimed they performed the attack to protest the company's lawsuits against farmers who manufacture organic milk\nin an effort to stop them from stating on the label that their milk does not contain artificial Bovine Growth Hormones\n.[55]\n\nMonsanto confirmed the attack but claimed that only about ten percent of the information published came from current or former employees of the company. They said that the other ninety percent were email addresses and names of media contacts and employees of other agricultural companies.[56]\n\n","On 21 July, Anonymous released two PDFs\npurportedly taken from servers belonging to NATO\n. They claimed via Twitter to have obtained around one gigabyte of data that they would release portions of over the course of a few days. The group claimed that some of the data was so sensitive that they felt it would be irresponsible to release, and thus would only make a portion of what was taken available. The first two documents released relate to outsourcing communication and information services\n(CIS) in Kosovo\nand the funding request for the project.[57]\n\n[58]\n\n","The Austrian\nbranch of Anonymous hacked the website of the Austrian Gebühren Info Service, the television license agency run by the Austrian national public service broadcaster\n, on 22 July. They accessed 214,000 records containing personal information and stole the banking data of 96,000 people from the server. The counter-terrorism bureau of the country launched an investigation and were preparing to file criminal complaints against those involved.[59]\n\n","On 25 July, first posted confidential information that they claimed came from the Italian\nCentro Nazionale Anticrimine Informatico per la Protezione delle Infrastrutture Critiche, translated as the National Anti-Crime Computer Center for Critical Infrastructure Protection, an agency tasked with protecting vital computer systems for the country. The Twitter account @anonesc posted less than 100 megabytes of data, but they claimed to have taken over eight gigabytes. The data related to oil\n, nuclear\n, and other firms deemed to be involved in \"critical infrastructure\", as well as government agencies including the Department of Defence\nof Australia\n.[60]\n\n","On 29 July, Anonymous hacked the FBI-contractor ManTech International\n. They posted a PDF of a résumé\nsent into the company as proof that they had infiltrated their systems. Anonymous claimed that the attack would be the first part of a promised \"Fuck FBI Friday\", or FFF, campaign as part of the larger Operation AntiSec.[61]\n\nThey published 400 megabytes of content from the company later the same day. The internal documents generally concern contracts that ManTech has with NATO, the nature of which Anonymous claims shows a waste of taxpayer money\n.[62]\n\nThe files also include dealings with the United States Army\nand a list of employee emails.[63]\n\n","On 31 July, Anonymous attacked the websites of 77 different law enforcement\nwebsites hosted on the same server. As much as 10 gigabytes of data was taken, including the personal information of police officers from numerous jurisdictions. Emails were also taken, as well as the confidential information of inmates and confidential informants\n, though not released yet. Anonymous said that they would redact inmate names but would release the names of all \" informants who had the false impression that they would be able to ‘anonymously’ snitch in secrecy.\" The release also included a demand that all arrested members of Anonymous be released immediately.[64]\n\nSome of the information released, however, was already publicly available.[65]\n\nThey proceeded to release the social security numbers\nof over 100 police officers from the Missouri Sheriffs' Association website.[66]\n\nThe following Saturday, 6 August, they released a cache of data from the websites title \"Shooting Sheriffs Saturday Release\" which included the information taken from law enforcement websites. Large amounts of personal information was included, with Anonymous stating, \"We have no sympathy for any of the officers or informants who may be endangered by the release of their personal information. For too long they have been using and abusing our personal information.\"[67]\n\nAnonymous claimed that their motive was revenge over the arrests of a number of participants in previous operations and of LulzSec and Anonymous member Topiary\n. They also used stolen credit card numbers\nto make donations to the American Civil Liberties Union\n, Electronic Frontier Foundation\n, and the Chelsea Manning\nSupport Network.[67]\n\n","On 16 August, Anonymous gained access to the email account of Richard Garcia, former Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI field office in Los Angeles\nand Senior Vice President\nof Vanguard Defense Industries, in the name of AntiSec. They claimed that the firm's relationships with United States military and law enforcement organizations made it a legitimate target as part of the operation. They also claimed to have breached the company's website, which was run on a WordPress\nplatform, though the company says that their website was never affected.[68]\n\nThe group released 1 gigabyte of information three days later, all of it taken from Garcia's personal email account; it mainly related to Garcia's former role with InfraGard.[69]\n\n","In retaliation for arrests of people who allegedly participated in Operation AntiSec, and especially Topiary\n, Anonymous attacked the website of the Texas Police Chiefs Association. On 1 September, the group defaced the website and released documents from it marked \"law enforcement sensitive\" and \"for official use only\". The release also included police officer private email. The same day, the group brought down the website of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nfor the justice system's characterization of Anonymous activities as \"cyber-terrorism\".[70]\n\n","On 21 October, announced a dump of data related to law enforcement in support of the Occupy Wall Street\nand Occupy movement\n. The dump including data taken from the International Association of Chiefs of Police\n, Boston Police Patrolmen's Association, and the Sheriff's office of Baldwin County, Alabama\n. A number of police websites virtually hosted\ntogether also had their content replaced with an anti-police rap\nvideo.[71]\n\nThe dump 600 megabytes of information including membership rosters, internal documents, and social security numbers from the International Association of Chiefs of Police; nearly 1000 names, ranks, addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers of police officers in Jefferson County, Alabama\nand Birmingham, Alabama\n; 1000 names and passwords of members of the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association; and the financial information and client list of web developer and marketing company Matrix Group, a business with several law enforcement clients.[71]\n\n[72]\n\nAntiSec claimed that at least 40 law enforcement related websites were included in the attack.[73]\n\n","On November 18, 2011, Anonymous posted 38,000 email messages from the Gmail\naccount of Alfredo \"Fred\" Baclagan, a special agent supervising computer crime investigations with the California Department of Justice\nand the Computer and Technology Crime Hightech Response Team, to a site on Tor\nand to The Pirate Bay\n.[74]\n\n[75]\n\nThey also added what they claimed were Baclagan's personal home address and phone number. The group claimed the action as part of their attack on law enforcement in support of the Occupy movement and in protest for prosecution of computer criminals in general. They also claimed to have read his text messages, listened to his voicemail, and used his Google Voice\naccount to call and text his friends and family.[74]\n\nThey also purchased a camera using his Google Wallet\n.[75]\n\nThe release includes forensic\nexperts discussing techniques for tracking cybercriminals and how different companies respond to law enforcement requests for information.[75]\n\n","On 4 September 2012, 1 million unique device IDs for Apple products were published by a group associated with Anonymous.[76]\n\nThe group claimed that the 1 million IDs were part of a dataset of 12.36 million records taken from an FBI laptop.[76]\n\nThe FBI responded by saying they were not aware of any unauthorized data release.[77]\n\n","According to an Ars Technica\narticle published on September 10:","A digital publishing company named BlueToad has come forward to take responsibility for the leak of a million iOS unique device identifiers (UDIDs) that were previously attributed to an alleged FBI laptop hack. In a number of interviews published Monday, BlueToad apologized to the public for the incident, explaining that hackers had broken into the company's systems in order to steal the file.[78]\n\n","The original announcement of Operation Anti-Security included a call from LulzSec to spread the name \"AntiSec\" through physical graffiti\n.[11]\n\nA few days after, a number of locations in Mission Beach, San Diego\nwere vandalized with pieces of graffiti reading the phrase.[79]\n\n[80]\n\n","On 4 July, a Fox News\nTwitter account (@foxnewspolitics) was hacked and false tweets reporting that President of the United States\nBarack Obama\nhas been shot three times and killed were sent from the account.[81]\n\nThe Script Kiddies\n, a group with close ties to Anonymous including two hackers with former membership in the group, claimed responsibility for the attack and hoax. The group claimed that the action was in the name of Operation Anti-Security and that they would continue looking to expose information on corporations \"to assist with antisec.\"[82]\n\nThe United States Secret Service\nis investigating the incident as a threat on the President.[83]\n\nThe group subsequently hacked into the Facebook\npage of pharmaceutical company Pfizer\n, claiming they did so for \"moral reasons\" as part of AntiSec.[84]\n\nThey posted numerous messages to the company's Facebook wall mocking their security.[85]\n\n","On 4 July, someone going by the name f1esc posted a file to The Pirate Bay\ncontaining 600 megabytes of information described as national \"AU election data\" and labelled with the tag #Antisec. In reality, the data concerned the 2011 New South Wales state election\nand was taken from a government website designed to provide election results where the data was publicly available, and the data proved freely accessible information instead of a hack.[86]\n\n","In early July, the group RedHack hacked into and defaced over 1000 websites based in Turkey. They claimed to do so both to mark the anniversary of the Sivas massacre\nand as part of Operation Anti-Security. The websites belonged both to agencies of the Government of Turkey\nand Adnan Oktar\n, an Islamic creationist\n. The group vowed to continue contribution to the AntiSec operation.[87]\n\n","On 6 July, a hacker called p0keu released of around 2,658 usernames, passwords hidden behind hash functions\n, and email addresses from the blog\nTamilCanadian.com. He gave no reason for why he chose the website to attack other than that he did so under the AntiSec label.[88]\n\nOn 14 July, he leaked part of the Stevens Institute of Technology\nwebsite database. At least 31 of the records in the database contained plain text files\nwith email addresses, user names, and passwords of site users. p0keu posted the user information to Pastebin.[89]\n\np0keu has continued hacking, but has not labelled all of his releases with the AntiSec slogan.[90]\n\n","In the Netherlands\n, a splinter group inspired by LulzSec formed, calling themselves AntiSec NL.

Four people believed by police to be members were later arrested.[91]\n\n","On 24 July, a group called BashCrew\nhacked the website of the House of Representatives of the Philippines\nin the name of AntiSec. The names, telephone numbers, and email addresses of members of the Filipino Congress were released via Pastebin, with the group claiming that they may also release blood types and the private websites of some members.[92]\n\n","A hacker going by the name Thehacker12, a self-purported AntiSec supporter but not a member of Anonymous, released data stolen from event management\ncompany allianceforbiz.com on 24 August 2011 on Mediafire and Pastebin. The release contained a spreadsheet\nof usernames, email addresses, passwords, employers, and other information of around 20,000 people, many of them United States government employees or contractors. The organization with the most employees compromised was the Small Business Administration\n.[93]\n\n","Law enforcement agencies in various countries have arrested or searched the property of alleged participants in Operation AntiSec. These suspects have come from different groups who carried out attacks as part of the operation. On 19 July 2011, the London Metropolitan Police announced the arrest of possible core LulzSec member T-flow. A 16-year-old male was arrested in South London on charges of violating the Computer Misuse Act as part of an operation involving the arrest of several other hackers affiliated with Anonymous in the United States and United Kingdom.[94]\n\n[95]\n\nOn the same day, the FBI arrested 21-year-old Lance Moore in Las Cruces, New Mexico\n. He was accused of stealing thousands of documents and applications from AT\u0026amp;T that LulzSec published as part of their so-called \"final release\" of the operation. LulzSec denied that any of their membership had been arrested, stating \"there are six of us, and we're all still here.\"[91]\n\n","On 20 July, prosecutors in the Netherlands released details of the arrests of four suspects aged 17, 18, 25, and 35. All were located in different Dutch cities and accused of being part of the hacking group AntiSec NL, an operation participant inspired by LulzSec. The four, going by the online handles Ziaolin, Calimero, DutchD3V1L, and Time, were arrested on 19 July and their computers and electronic equipment confiscated as evidence.

Details relating to an attack on Sony and hundreds of thousands of email addresses and passwords were found on the computer.[98]\n\nA London court released Davis on bail under the conditions that he live under curfew with his parents and have no access to the internet. His lawyer Gideon Cammerman stated that, while his client did help publicize LulzSec and Anonymous attacks, he lacks the technical skills to have been anything but a sympathizer.[98]\n\n","In early September 2011, Scotland Yard made two further arrests relating to LulzSec. Police arrested a 24-year-old male in Mexborough\n, South Yorkshire\nand a 20-year-old male in Warminster\n, Wiltshire\n.

The FBI revealed that supposed LulzSec leader Hector Xavier Monsegur, who went by the username Sabu, had been aiding law enforcement since pleading guilty to twelve counts, including conspiracy and computer hacking, on 15 August 2011 as part of a plea deal\n.[100]\n\nIn exchange for his cooperation, federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute Monsegur for his computer hacking, and also not to prosecute him for two attempts to sell marijuana\n, possession of an illegal handgun, purchasing stolen property, charging $15,000 to his former employer's credit card in a case of identity theft\n, and directing people to buy prescription drugs from illegal sources. He still faces a misdemeanor charge of impersonating a federal agent\n.[101]\n\nFive suspects were charged with conspiracy: Jake Davis, accused of being the hacker \"Topiary\" (who had been previously arrested); Ryan Ackroyd of London, accused of being \"Kayla\"; Darren Martyn of Ireland, accused of being \"pwnsauce\"; Donncha O’Cearrbhail of Ireland, accused of being \"palladium\"; and Jeremy Hammond\nof Chicago\n, accused of being \"Anarchaos\".

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df1f0262df3aa1b2f574"},"content":{"contents":["The 2011 PlayStation Network outage\nwas the result of an \"external intrusion\n\" on Sony\n's PlayStation Network\nand Qriocity\nservices, in which personal details from approximately 77 million accounts were compromised and prevented users of PlayStation 3\nand PlayStation Portable\nconsoles from accessing the service.[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\nThe attack occurred between April 17 and April 19, 2011,[1]\n\nforcing Sony to turn off the PlayStation Network on April 20. On May 4 Sony confirmed that personally identifiable information\nfrom each of the 77 million accounts had been exposed.[5]\n\nThe outage lasted 23 days.[6]\n\n","At the time of the outage, with a count of 77 million registered PlayStation Network accounts,[7]\n\nit was one of the largest data security breaches in history.[8]\n\n[9]\n\nIt surpassed the 2007 TJX hack\nwhich affected 45 million customers.[10]\n\nGovernment officials in various countries voiced concern\nover the theft and Sony's one-week delay before warning its users.","Sony stated on April 26 that it was attempting to get online services running \"within a week.\"[11]\n\nOn May 14, Sony released PlayStation 3 firmware\nversion 3.61 as a security patch. The firmware required users to change their password upon signing in. At the time the firmware was released, the network was still offline.[12]\n\nRegional restoration was announced by Kazuo Hirai\nin a video from Sony.[13]\n\nA map of regional restoration and the network within the United States was shared as the service was coming back online.[14]\n\n","","","On April 20, 2011, Sony acknowledged that on the official PlayStation Blog that it was \"aware certain functions of the PlayStation Network\" were down. Upon attempting to sign in via the PlayStation 3\n, users received a message indicating that the network was \"undergoing maintenance\".[15]\n\n[16]\n\nThe following day, Sony asked its customers for patience while the cause of outage was investigated and stated that it may take \"a full day or two\" to get the service fully functional again.[17]\n\n","The company later announced an \"external intrusion\" had affected the PlayStation Network and Qriocity services.[18]\n\nThis intrusion occurred between April 17 and April 19. On April 20, Sony suspended all PlayStation Network and Qriocity services worldwide.[19]\n\nSony expressed their regrets for the downtime and called the task of repairing the system \"time-consuming\" but would lead to a stronger network infrastructure and additional security.[20]\n\nOn April 25, Sony spokesman Patrick Seybold reiterated on the PlayStation Blog that fixing and enhancing the network was a \"time intensive\" process with no estimated time of completion.[21]\n\nHowever, the next day Sony stated that there was a \"clear path to have PlayStation Network and Qriocity systems back online\", with some services expected to be restored within a week. Furthermore, Sony acknowledged the \"compromise of personal information as a result of an illegal intrusion on our systems.\"[22]\n\n","On May 1 Sony announced a \"Welcome Back\" program for customers affected by the outage. The company also confirmed that some PSN and Qriocity services would be available during the first week of May.[23]\n\n[24]\n\nThe list of services expected to become available included:[25]\n\n","On May 2 Sony issued a press release, according to which the Sony Online Entertainment\n(SOE) services had been taken offline for maintenance due to potentially related activities during the initial criminal hack. Over 12,000 credit card numbers, albeit in encrypted\nform, from non-U.S. cardholders and additional information from 24.7 million SOE accounts may have been accessed.[26]\n\n[27]\n\n","During the week, Sony sent a letter to the US House of Representatives\n, answering questions and concerns about the event.[28]\n\nIn the letter Sony announced that they would be providing Identity Theft insurance policies in the amount of $1 million USD per user of the PlayStation Network and Qriocity services, despite no reports of credit card fraud being indicated. This was later confirmed on the PlayStation Blog, where it was announced that the service, AllClear ID\nPlus powered by Debix\n, would be available to users in the United States free for 12 months, and would include Internet surveillance, complete identity repair in the event of theft and a $1 million identity theft insurance policy for each user.[29]\n\n[30]\n\n","On May 6 Sony stated they had begun \"final stages of internal testing\" for the PlayStation Network, which had been rebuilt.[31]\n\nHowever, the following day Sony reported that they would not be able to bring services back online within the one-week timeframe given on May 1, because \"the extent of the attack on Sony Online Entertainment servers\" had not been known at the time.[32]\n\nSOE confirmed on their Twitter\naccount that their games would not be available until sometime after the weekend.[33]\n\n","Reuters began reporting the event as \"the biggest Internet security break-in ever\".[34]\n\nA Sony spokesperson said:[35]\n\n","On May 14 various services began coming back online on a country-by-country basis, starting with North America.[36]\n\nThese services included: sign-in for PSN and Qriocity services (including password resetting), online game-play on PS3 and PSP, playback of rental video content, Music Unlimited service (PS3 and PC), access to third party services (such as Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and MLB.tv), friends list, chat functionality and PlayStation Home.[36]\n\nThe actions came with a firmware update for the PS3, version 3.61.[37]\n\nAs of May 15 service in Japan and East Asia had not yet been approved.[38]\n\n","On May 18 SOE shut down the password reset page on their site following the discovery of another exploit[39]\n\nthat allowed users to reset other users' passwords, using the other user's email address\nand date of birth.[40]\n\nSign-in using PSN details to various other Sony websites was also disabled, but console sign-ins were not affected.[39]\n\n","On May 23 Sony stated that the outage costs were $171 million.[41]\n\n","Sony reported on May 4 to the PlayStation Blog[42]\n\nthat:","Kazuo Hirai, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sony Computer Entertainment America, submitted written answers to questions posed by the United States House subcommittee about the large-scale, criminal cyber-attack we have experienced.","Sony relayed via the letter that:","In summary, we told the subcommittee that in dealing with this cyber attack we followed four key principles:","\nWe also informed the subcommittee of the following:","On April 26, 2011 Sony explained on the PlayStation Blog why it took so long to inform PSN users of the data theft:[43]\n\n","There’s a difference in timing between when we identified there was an intrusion and when we learned of consumers’ data being compromised. We learned there was an intrusion April 19th and subsequently shut the services down. We then brought in outside experts to help us learn how the intrusion occurred and to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. It was necessary to conduct several days of forensic analysis, and it took our experts until yesterday to understand the scope of the breach. We then shared that information with our consumers and announced it publicly this afternoon.","Possible data theft\nled Sony to provide an update in regards to a criminal investigation in a blog posted on April 27: \"We are currently working with law enforcement on this matter as well as a recognized technology security firm to conduct a complete investigation. This malicious attack against our system and against our customers is a criminal act and we are proceeding aggressively to find those responsible.\"[44]\n\n","On May 3 Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Kazuo Hirai\nreiterated this and said the \"external intrusion\" which had caused them to shut down the PlayStation Network constituted a \"criminal cyber attack\".[45]\n\nHirai expanded further, claiming that Sony systems had been under attack prior to the outage \"for the past month and half\", suggesting a concerted attempt to target Sony.[46]\n\n","On May 4 Sony announced that it was adding Data Forte to the investigation team of Guidance Software and Protiviti\nin analysing the attacks. Legal aspects of the case were handled by Baker \u0026amp; McKenzie.[47]\n\nSony stated their belief that Anonymous\n, or some portion thereof, may have performed the attack.[48]\n\nAnonymous denied any involvement.[49]\n\n","Upon learning that a breach had occurred, Sony launched an internal investigation. Sony reported, in its letter to the United States Congress:","One of our first calls was to the FBI, and this is an active, on-going investigation.\n\nHave you identified how the breach occurred?\n\n\nYes, we believe so. Sony Network Entertainment America is continuing its investigation into this criminal intrusion, and more detailed information could be discovered during this process. We are reluctant to make full details publicly available because the information is the subject of an on-going criminal investigation and also the information could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in systems other than Sony's that have similar architecture to the PlayStation Network.[50]\n\n","While most games remained playable in their offline modes, the PlayStation 3\nwas unable to play certain Capcom\ntitles in any form.[51]\n\nStreaming video providers throughout different regions such as Hulu\n, Vudu\n, Netflix\nand LoveFilm\ndisplayed the same maintenance message. Some users claimed to be able to use Netflix's streaming service[52]\n\nbut others were unable.[53]\n\n","On April 26 nearly a week after the outage, Sony confirmed that it \"cannot rule out the possibility\"[54]\n\nthat personally identifiable information\nsuch as PlayStation Network account username, password, home address, and email address had been compromised. Sony also mentioned the possibility that credit card data was taken—after claiming that encryption had been placed on the databases, which would partially satisfy PCI Compliance\nfor storing credit card information on a server. Subsequent to the announcement on both the official blog and by e-mail, users were asked to safeguard credit card transactions by checking bank statements. This warning came nearly a week after the initial \"external intrusion\n\" and while the Network was turned off.[55]\n\n","Some disputed this explanation and queried that if Sony deemed the situation so severe that they had to turn off the network, Sony should have warned users of possible data theft sooner than on April 26.[56]\n\nConcerns have been raised over violations of PCI Compliance\nand the failure to immediately notify users. US Senator\nRichard Blumenthal\nwrote to Sony Computer Entertainment America CEO Jack Tretton\nquestioning the delay.[57]\n\n","Sony replied in a letter to the subcommittee:","Your statement indicated you have no evidence at this time that credit card information was obtained, yet you cannot rule out this possibility. Please explain why you do not believe credit card information was obtained and why you cannot determine if the data was in fact taken.\n","As stated above, Sony Network Entertainment America has not been able to conclude with certainty through the forensic analysis done to date that credit card information was not transferred from the PlayStation Network system. We know that for other personal information contained in the account database, the hacker made queries to the database, and the external forensics teams have seen large amounts of data transferred in response to those queries. Our forensics teams have not seen the queries and corresponding data transfers of the credit card information.","Credit card data was encrypted, but Sony admitted that other user information was not encrypted at the time of the intrusion.[44]\n\n[58]\n\nThe Daily Telegraph\n\nreported that \"If the provider stores passwords unencrypted, then it's very easy for somebody else – not just an external attacker, but members of staff or contractors working on Sony's site – to get access and discover those passwords, potentially using them for nefarious means.\"[59]\n\nOn May 2, Sony clarified the \"unencrypted\" status of users' passwords, stating that:[60]\n\n","While the passwords that were stored were not “encrypted,” they were transformed using a cryptographic hash function\n. There is a difference between these two types of security measures which is why we said the passwords had not been encrypted. But I want to be very clear that the passwords were not stored in our database in cleartext form.","Following a formal investigation of Sony for breaches of the UK's Data Protection Act 1998\n, the Information Commissioners' Office issued a statement highly critical of the security Sony had in place:","If you are responsible for so many payment card details and log-in details then keeping that personal data secure has to be your priority. In this case that just didn't happen, and when the database was targeted – albeit in a determined criminal attack – the security measures in place were simply not good enough.","There's no disguising that this is a business that should have known better. It is a company that trades on its technical expertise, and there's no doubt in my mind that they had access to both the technical knowledge and the resources to keep this information safe.[61]\n\n","Sony was fined £250,000 ($395k) for security measures so poor they did not comply with the British law.","On May 3 Sony stated in a press release that there may be a correlation between the attack that had occurred on April 16 towards the PlayStation Network and one that compromised Sony Online Entertainment\non May 2.[26]\n\nThis portion of the attack resulted in the theft of information on 24.6 million Sony Online Entertainment account holders. The database contained 12,700 credit card numbers, particularly those of non-U.S. residents, and had not been in use since 2007 as much of the data applied to expired cards and deleted accounts. Sony updated this information the following day by stating that only 900 cards on the database were still valid.[62]\n\nThe attack resulted in the suspension of SOE servers and Facebook\ngames. SOE granted 30 days of free time, plus one day for each day the server was down, to users of Clone Wars Adventures\n\n, DC Universe Online\n\n, EverQuest\n\n, EverQuest II\n\n, EverQuest Online Adventures\n\n, Free Realms\n\n, Pirates of the Burning Sea\n\n, PlanetSide\n\n, Poxnora\n\n, Star Wars Galaxies\n\nand Vanguard: Saga of Heroes\n\n, as well as other forms of compensation for all other Sony Online games.","Security experts Eugene Lapidous of AnchorFree, Chester Wisniewski of Sophos Canada\nand Avner Levin of Ryerson University\ncriticized Sony, questioning its methods of securing user data. Lapidous called the breach \"difficult to excuse\" and Wisniewski called it \"an act of hubris or simply gross incompetence\".[63]\n\n[64]\n\n[65]\n\n[66]\n\n","Sony hosted special events after the PlayStation Network returned to service. Sony stated that they had plans for PS3 versions of DC Universe Online and Free Realms to help alleviate some of their losses.[67]\n\nIn a press conference in Tokyo on May 1, Sony announced a \"Welcome Back\" program. As well as \"selected PlayStation entertainment content\" the program promised to include 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members, while existing PlayStation Plus members received an additional 30 days on their subscription.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df220262df3aa1b2f575"},"content":{"contents":["RSA SecurID\n, formerly referred to as SecurID\n, is a mechanism developed by Security Dynamics (later RSA Security and now RSA, The Security Division of EMC\n) for performing two-factor authentication\nfor a user to a network resource.","","","The RSA SecurID authentication mechanism consists of a \"token\n\" — either hardware (e.g. a key fob\n) or software (a soft token\n) — which is assigned to a computer user and which creates an authentication code at fixed intervals (usually 60 seconds) using a built-in clock and the card's factory-encoded almost random key\n(known as the \"seed\"). The seed is different for each token, and is loaded into the corresponding RSA SecurID server (RSA Authentication Manager, formerly ACE/Server[1]\n\n) as the tokens are purchased.[2]\n\nOn-demand tokens are also available, which provide a tokencode via email or SMS delivery, eliminating the need to provision a token to the user.","The token hardware is designed to be tamper-resistant\nto deter reverse engineering\n. When software implementations of the same algorithm (\"software tokens\") appeared on the market, public code had been developed by the security community allowing a user to emulate RSA SecurID in software, but only if they have access to a current RSA SecurID code, and the original 64-bit RSA SecurID seed file introduced to the server.[3]\n\nLater, the 128-bit RSA SecurID algorithm was published as part of an open source library.[4]\n\nIn the RSA SecurID authentication scheme, the seed record is the secret key used to generate one-time passwords\n. Newer versions also feature a USB connector, which allows the token to be used as a smart card\n-like device for securely storing certificates\n.[5]\n\n","A user authenticating to a network resource—say, a dial-in server or a firewall—needs to enter both a personal identification number\nand the number being displayed at that moment\non their RSA SecurID token. Though increasingly rare, some systems using RSA SecurID disregard PIN implementation altogether, and rely on password/RSA SecurID code combinations. The server, which also has a real-time clock and a database of valid cards with the associated seed records, authenticates a user by computing what number the token is supposed to be showing at that moment in time and checking this against what the user entered.","On older versions of SecurID, a \"duress PIN\" may be used—an alternate code which creates a security event log showing that a user was forced to enter their PIN, while still providing transparent authentication.[6]\n\nUsing the duress PIN would allow one successful authentication, after which the token will automatically be disabled. The \"duress PIN\" feature has been deprecated and is not available on currently supported versions.","While the RSA SecurID system adds a layer of security to a network, difficulty can occur if the authentication server's clock becomes out of sync with the clock built into the authentication tokens. Normal token clock drift is accounted for automatically by the server by adjusting a stored \"drift\" value over time. If the out of sync condition is not a result of normal hardware token clock drift, correcting the synchronization of the Authentication Manager server clock with the out of sync token (or tokens) can be accomplished in several different ways. If the server clock had drifted and the administrator made a change to the system clock, the tokens can either be resynchronized one-by-one, or the stored drift values adjusted manually. The drift can be done on individual tokens or in bulk using a command line utility.","RSA Security has pushed forth an initiative called \"Ubiquitous Authentication\", partnering with device manufacturers such as IronKey\n, SanDisk\n, Motorola\n, Freescale Semiconductor\n, Redcannon, Broadcom\n, and BlackBerry\nto embed the SecurID software into everyday devices such as USB flash drives and cell phones, to reduce cost and the number of objects that the user must carry.[7]\n\n","Token codes are easily stolen, because no mutual-authentication exists (anything that can steal a password can also steal a token code). This is significant, since it is the principal threat most users believe they are solving with this technology.","The simplest practical vulnerability with any password container is losing the special key device or the activated smart phone with the integrated key function. Such vulnerability cannot be healed with any single token container device within the preset time span of activation. All further consideration presumes loss prevention, e.g. by additional electronic leash\nor body sensor and alarm.","While RSA SecurID tokens offer a level of protection against password replay attacks\n, they are not designed to offer protection against man in the middle\ntype attacks when used alone. If the attacker manages to block the authorized user from authenticating to the server until the next token code will be valid, he will be able to log into the server. Risk-based analytics (RBA), a new feature in the latest version (8.0) provides significant protection against this type of attack if the user is enabled and authenticating on an agent enabled for RBA. RSA SecurID does not prevent man in the browser\n(MitB) based attacks.[8]\n\n","SecurID authentication server tries to prevent password sniffing and simultaneous login by declining both authentication requests, if two valid credentials are presented within a given time frame. This has been documented in an unverified post by John G. Brainard.[9]\n\nIf the attacker removes from the user the ability to authenticate however, the SecurID server will assume that it is the user who is actually authenticating and hence will allow the attacker's authentication through. Under this attack model, the system security can be improved using encryption/authentication mechanisms such as SSL\n.","Although soft tokens may be more convenient, critics indicate that the tamper-resistant\nproperty of hard tokens is unmatched in soft token implementations,[10]\n\nwhich could allow seed record secret keys to be duplicated and user impersonation to occur.","Hard tokens, on the other hand, can be physically stolen (or acquired via social engineering\n) from end users. The small form factor makes hard token theft much more viable than laptop/desktop scanning. A user will typically wait more than one day before reporting the device as missing, giving the attacker plenty of time to breach the unprotected system. This could only occur, however, if the users UserID and PIN are also known. Risk-based analytics can provide additional protection against the use of lost or stolen tokens, even if the users UserID and PIN are known by the attackers.","Batteries go flat periodically, requiring complicated replacement and re-enrollment procedures.","Clock drift also affects some tokens (especially infrequently used ones), requiring time-consuming server-side re-sync with the provider.","As of 2003, RSA SecurID commanded over 70% of the two-factor authentication market[11]\n\nand 25 million devices have been produced to date.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nA number of competitors, such as VASCO\n, make similar security tokens\n, mostly based on the open OATH HOTP\nstandard. A study on OTP published by Gartner\nin 2010 mentions OATH and SecurID as the only competitors.[12]\n\n","Other network authentication systems, such as OPIE\nand S/Key\n(sometimes more generally known as OTP\n, as S/Key is a trademark of Telcordia Technologies\n, formerly Bellcore\n) attempt to provide the \"something you have\" level of authentication without requiring a hardware token.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","On 17 March 2011, RSA announced that they had been victims of \"an extremely sophisticated cyber attack\".[13]\n\nConcerns were raised specifically in reference to the SecurID system, saying that \"this information could potentially be used to reduce the effectiveness of a current two-factor authentication implementation\". However, their formal Form 8-K\nsubmission[14]\n\nindicated that they did not believe the breach would have a \"material impact on its financial results\". The breach cost EMC, the parent company of RSA, $66.3 million, which was taken as a charge against second quarter earnings. It covered costs to investigate the attack, harden its IT systems and monitor transactions of corporate customers, according to EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David Goulden, in a conference call with analysts.\n","The breach into RSA's network was carried out by hackers who sent phishing\nemails to two targeted, small groups of employees of RSA.[15]\n\nAttached to the email was an Excel file containing malware\n. When an RSA employee opened the Excel file, the malware exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash. The exploit\nallowed the hackers to use the Poison Ivy Remote Administration Tool\nto gain control of machines and access servers in RSA's network.[16]\n\n","There are some hints that the breach involved the theft of RSA's database mapping token serial numbers to the secret token \"seeds\" that were injected to make each one unique.[17]\n\nReports of RSA executives telling customers to \"ensure that they protect the serial numbers on their tokens\"[18]\n\nlend credibility to this hypothesis.","Barring a fatal weakness in the cryptographic implementation of the token code generation algorithm (which is unlikely, since it involves the simple and direct application of the extensively scrutinized AES-128\nblock cipher\n[citation needed\n\n\n]\n), the only circumstance under which an attacker could mount a successful attack without physical possession of the token is if the token seed records themselves had been leaked.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nRSA stated it did not release details about the extent of the attack so as to not give potential attackers information they could use in figuring out how to attack the system.[19]\n\n","On 6 June 2011, RSA offered token replacements or free security monitoring services to any of its more than 30,000 SecurID customers, following an attempted cyber breach on defense customer Lockheed Martin\nthat appeared to be related to the SecurID information stolen from RSA.[20]\n\nIn spite of the resulting attack on one of its defense customers, company chairman Art Coviello said that \"We believe and still believe that the customers are protected\".[21]\n\n","In April 2011, unconfirmed rumors cited L-3 Communications\nas having been attacked as a result of the RSA compromise.[22]\n\n","In May 2011, this information was used to attack Lockheed Martin\nsystems.[23]\n\n[24]\n\nHowever Lockheed Martin claims that due to \"aggressive actions\" by the company's information security team, \"No customer, program or employee personal

He also said that the holders of the compromised accounts would find their passwords were no longer valid on the website.[5]\n\n","The stolen passwords, which were hashed (i.e. just a checksum was stored, allowing testing whether a given password is the correct one), were cracked and posted on a Russian password forum later on that day. By the morning of June 6, passwords for thousands of accounts were available online in plain text. Graham Cluley of the internet security firm Sophos\nwarned that the leaked passwords could be in the possession of criminals by 6 June.[6]\n\nLinkedIn said, in an official statement, that they would email all its members with security instructions and instructions on how they could reset their passwords.[7]\n\n","In May 2016, LinkedIn discovered an additional 100 million email addresses and hashed passwords that claimed to be additional data from the same 2012 breach. In response, LinkedIn invalidated the passwords of all users that had not changed their passwords since 2012.[8]\n\n","","","Rep. Mary Bono Mack\nof the United States Congress\ncommented on the incident, \"How many times is this going to happen before Congress finally wakes up and takes action? This latest incident once again brings into sharp focus the need to pass data protection legislation.\" Senator Patrick Leahy\nsaid, \"Reports of another major data breach\nshould give pause to American consumers who, now more than ever, share sensitive personal information in their online transactions and networking\u0026#160;... Congress should make comprehensive data privacy\nand cybercrime legislation a top priority.\"[9]\n\n[10]\n\nMarcus Carey, a security researcher for Rapid7\n, said that the hackers had penetrated the databases of LinkedIn in the preceding days.[11]\n\nHe expressed concerns that they may have had access to the website even after the attack. Michael Aronowitz, Vice President of Saveology\nsaid, \"Everyday hundreds of sites are hacked and personal information is obtained. Stealing login information from one account can easily be used to access other accounts, which can hold personal and financial information.\" Security experts indicated that the stolen passwords were encrypted in a way that was fairly easy to decrypt, which was one of the reasons for the data breach.[12]\n\nKatie Szpyrka, a long time user of LinkedIn from Illinois\n, United States, filed a $5 million lawsuit against LinkedIn, complaining that the company did not keep their promises to secure connections and databases. Erin O’Harra, a spokeswoman working for LinkedIn, when asked about the lawsuit, said that lawyers were looking to take advantage of that situation to again propose the bills SOPA\nand PIPA\nin the United States Congress\n.[13]\n\nAn amended complaint was filed on Nov. 26, 2012 on behalf of Szpyrka and another premium LinkedIn user from Virginia\n, United States, named Khalilah Gilmore–Wright, as class representatives for all LinkedIn users who were affected by the breach.[14]\n\nThe lawsuit sought injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as restitution and damages for the plaintiffs and members of the class.[14]\n\n","LinkedIn apologized immediately after the data breach, and asked its users to immediately change their passwords.[1]\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation\nassisted the LinkedIn Corporation in investigating the theft. As of 8 June 2012, the investigation was still in its early stages, and the company said it was unable to determine whether the hackers were also able to steal the email addresses associated with the compromised user accounts as well.[15]\n\nLinkedIn said that the users whose passwords are compromised would be unable to access their LinkedIn accounts using their old passwords.[16]\n\n","Internet security experts said that the passwords were easy to unscramble because of LinkedIn's failure to use a salt\nwhen hashing them, which is considered an insecure practice because it allows attackers to quickly reverse the scrambling process using existing standard rainbow tables\n, pre-made lists of matching scrambled and unscrambled passwords.[17]\n\nAnother issue that sparked controversy was the iOS\napp provided by LinkedIn, which grabs personal names, emails, and notes from a mobile calendar without the user's approval.[18]\n\nSecurity experts working for Skycure Security said that the application collects a user's personal data and sends it to the LinkedIn server. LinkedIn claimed the permission for this feature is user-granted, and the information is sent securely using the Secure Sockets Layer\n(SSL) protocol. The company added that it had never stored or shared that information with a third party.[19]\n\n","On October 5, 2016, Russian hacker Yevgeny Nikulin was detained by Czech\npolice in Prague\n. The United States had requested an Interpol\nwarrant for him.[20]\n\n","A United States grand jury indicted Nikulin and three unnamed co-conspirators on charges of aggravated identity theft\nand computer intrusion. Prosecutors alleged that Nikulin stole a LinkedIn employee's username and password, using them to gain access to the corporation's network. Nikulin was also accused of hacking into Dropbox\nand Formspring\n, allegedly conspiring to sell stolen Formspring customer data, including usernames, e-mail addresses, and passwords.[21]\n\n","Nikulin is facing a Czech hearing to determine whether he will be extradited to the United States.[20]\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova\nindicated that Russian authorities were trying to block the extradition.[22]\n\n"],"title":"2012 LinkedIn hack","rels":["/wiki/Bright.com","/wiki/Lynda.com","/wiki/Pulse_(app)","/wiki/SlideShare","/wiki/Reid_Hoffman","/wiki/Rashmi_Sinha","/wiki/Lynda_Weinman","/wiki/222_Second_Street","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/February_2010_Australian_cyberattacks","/wiki/Operation_Aurora","/wiki/Operation_Payback","/wiki/DigiNotar","/wiki/HBGary","/wiki/Operation_AntiSec","/wiki/Operation_Tunisia","/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage","/wiki/RSA_SecurID#March_2011_system_compromise","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak","/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack","/wiki/Snapchat#December_2013_hack","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#August_2013_breach","/wiki/Anthem_medical_data_breach","/wiki/Operation_Tovar","/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos","/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack","/wiki/2014_Russian_hacker_password_theft","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach","/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach","/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach","/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach","/wiki/VTech#2015_data_breach","/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack","/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery","/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center#Ransomware","/wiki/Commission_on_Elections_data_breach","/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack","/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/2017_Westminster_cyberattack","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/2017_cyberattacks_on_Ukraine","/wiki/Equifax#May–July_2017_data_breach","/wiki/Deloitte#2016–17_email_hack","/wiki/Disqus#October_2017_security_breach","/wiki/Anonymous_(group)","/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous","/wiki/Bureau_121","/wiki/Cozy_Bear","/wiki/CyberBerkut","/wiki/Derp_(hacker_group)","/wiki/Equation_Group","/wiki/Fancy_Bear","/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America","/wiki/Goatse_Security","/wiki/Guccifer_2.0","/wiki/Hacking_Team","/wiki/Iranian_Cyber_Army","/wiki/Lizard_Squad","/wiki/LulzRaft","/wiki/LulzSec","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack#Perpetrators","/wiki/NullCrew","/wiki/NSO_Group","/wiki/PayPal_14","/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398","/wiki/PLATINUM_(cybercrime_group)","/wiki/Pranknet","/wiki/RedHack","/wiki/Rocket_Kitten","/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers","/wiki/Syrian_Electronic_Army","/wiki/TeaMp0isoN","/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations","/wiki/UGNazi","/wiki/Yemen_Cyber_Army","/wiki/George_Hotz","/wiki/Guccifer","/wiki/Hector_Monsegur","/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond","/wiki/Junaid_Hussain","/wiki/Kristoffer_von_Hassel","/wiki/Mustafa_Al-Bassam","/wiki/MLT_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Ryan_Ackroyd","/wiki/Topiary_(hacktivist)","/wiki/The_Jester_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Weev","/wiki/Evercookie","/wiki/ISeeYou","/wiki/Heartbleed","/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)","/wiki/POODLE","/wiki/Rootpipe","/wiki/Row_hammer","/wiki/JASBUG","/wiki/Stagefright_(bug)","/wiki/DROWN_attack","/wiki/Badlock","/wiki/Dirty_COW","/wiki/Cloudbleed","/wiki/Broadcom#Vulnerabilities","/wiki/EternalBlue","/wiki/DoublePulsar","/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology#Silent_Bob_is_Silent","/wiki/KRACK","/wiki/ROCA_vulnerability","/wiki/BlueBorne_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Ransomware#Bad_Rabbit","/wiki/Careto_(malware)","/wiki/CryptoLocker","/wiki/Dexter_(malware)","/wiki/Duqu","/wiki/Duqu_2.0","/wiki/FinFisher","/wiki/Flame_(malware)","/wiki/Gameover_ZeuS","/wiki/Mahdi_(malware)","/wiki/Metulji_botnet","/wiki/Mirai_(malware)","/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog","/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club#Staatstrojaner_affair","/wiki/Shamoon","/wiki/Stars_virus","/wiki/Stuxnet","/wiki/Vault_7","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/X-Agent","/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack","/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df280262df3aa1b2f577"},"content":{"contents":["The 2012–13 Stratfor email leak\nis the public disclosure of a number of internal emails between global intelligence\ncompany Stratfor\n's employees and its clients, referred to by WikiLeaks\nas the Global Intelligence Files. E-mails began appearing on WikiLeaks on February 27, 2012, with 5,543,061 emails published as of July 18, 2014.[1]\n\n","The e-mails are claimed to include client information, notes between Stratfor employees and internal procedural documentation on securing intelligence data.[2]\n\nThese communications date from July 2004 through to December 2011.[3]\n\nWikiLeaks said it had obtained the e-mails from the hacker group Anonymous\n, who broke into Stratfor's computer network in 2011\n.[4]\n\nIn an initial announcement, WikiLeaks stated that they opened up a database\nof the emails to two dozen media organizations operating in several countries, including the McClatchy Company\n, href=\"/wiki/L%27Espresso\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"L'Espresso\"\u003el'Espresso\n\n, la Repubblica\n\n, ARD\n, the Russia Reporter\n\n,[5]\n\nand Rolling Stone\n\n,[4]\n\nalong with a \"sneak preview\" to the Yes Men\n.[5]\n\n","","","One of the first items released was an email containing a glossary titled \"The Stratfor Glossary of Useful, Baffling and Strange Intelligence Terms\", which contained concise and sometimes humorously candid definitions, along with pointed assessments of U.S. intelligence and law enforcement.[6]\n\n","Some emails reveal that Stratfor had been partnering with Shea Morenz, a former Goldman Sachs\ndirector, along with other informants, in order to profit from what could be considered insider trading\n. Stratfor planned to use the intelligence it gathered in order to profit from trading in several worldwide markets. They created an offshore \"share structure\" known as \"StratCap\" during 2011, in order to avoid insider trading allegations. The offshore entity, set to launch operations in 2012, is outwardly independent of Stratfor, but CEO George Friedman told his employees that StratCap is secretly integrated with Stratfor.[7]\n\n[8]\n\n","Friedman stated in an email that in order to avoid legal repercussions from these activities, the company would be \"retaining a law firm to create a policy for Stratfor on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\n.\"[8]\n\n","Thomas Kavaler, who was once a lawyer for a Stratfor client, had his email address and the password to his Stratfor account released in the leak. He is married to Judge Preska\n, who denied Jeremy Hammond\n's bail; the hearing was held eight months into Hammond's imprisonment.[9]\n\nThis apparent conflict of interest has led some observers to question the legality of her ruling.[10]\n\n","An email involving a Stratfor analyst stated that it had been determined that up to 12 officials in Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence\n(ISI) agency knew of Osama bin-Laden\n's safe house.[11]\n\nAnother email indicated that Stratfor Vice President Fred Burton\nhad knowledge of the killing of bin Laden\n, and that the body was not dumped at sea, but rather sent to Dover Air Force Base\nin the United States.[12]\n\nThis further fueled doubts about the US Government's account of the killings.\n[13]\n\n","Ynetnews\n\nreported that, according to internal emails between Stratfor employees, Israel\nand Russia\nwere engaged in an exchange of information in 2008. Israel gave Russia \"'data link codes' for unmanned aerial vehicles that the Jewish state sold to Georgia\n\" and that Russia gave \"the codes for Tor-M1\nmissile defense systems that Russia sold Iran\". The emails also stated that, during the 2008 South Ossetia war\n, Georgia \"realized that their UAVs were compromised and were looking for a replacement for the Israeli made drones\".[14]\n\n","International Business Times\n\nreported that Stratfor had found that several Central European\ncountries, especially the Czech Republic\n, have been petitioning NATO\nfor missile defenses and F-16s\nto use against Russia. The Czech Republic, according to an unknown Stratfor source, has stated that, if the talks with the US fail, then it will be breaking all ties with NATO and the US in general.[15]\n\n","Business Insider\n\nreported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\nwas an intelligence source for Stratfor between 2007 and 2010. In emails, Fred Burton discussed his personal communications with Netanyahu. Burton stated by email that Netanyahu informed him of his success in consolidating power within the Likud party\nahead of regaining the position of prime minister, shared thoughts regarding his distrust of US President Barack Obama\n, threatened assassination of Hezbollah\nleader Hasan Nasrallah\n, and declared intentions to unilaterally start a war against Iran\n.[16]\n\n","Al Akhbar\n\n, citing internal emails from the Stratfor hack, reported former Blackwater\ndirector James F. Smith had a relationship with Stratfor and was for a time considered one of their major sources. Emails appeared to show that Smith participated in the murder of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi\n, and had more recently been assigned to aid the rebellion against the government of Bashar al-Assad\nin Syria\n. In relation to his assignment to Syria, Smith requested an intelligence overview of the Syrian opposition\nfrom his Stratfor briefers.[17]\n\n","Over 40,000 documents related with information gathering from Venezuela\nincluding the status of the army (equipment, numbers, plans) and other sensitive information were also released. Various attempts at overthrowing the government of Hugo Chavez\nare described from sources inside Venezuela, with references to names Such as Antonio Ledezma\n(Caracas mayor), Henrique Capriles\n(opposition leader), Leopoldo Lopez\n, Rafael Poleo\n(media tycoon). Many papers involve CANVAS\n, as one of the main strategic counsel. One of the documents is titled \"how to guide to revolution\".[18]\n\n[19]\n\n[20]\n\n","As reported by The Times of India\n\n, some of the emails reveal that Stratfor was allegedly hired by Dow Chemical Company\nto spy on protesters of the Bhopal disaster\n.[3]\n\nDow Chemical Company responded with a written statement that read: \"Major companies are often required to take appropriate action to protect their people and safeguard their facilities,\" and that it had not broken any laws.[4]\n\n","The Minneapolis Star Tribune\n\nreported that, according to some of the released emails, the Coca-Cola Company\npaid Stratfor to determine \"to what extent will US-based PETA\nsupporters travel to Canada to support activism\" at the 2010 Olympics\n. The Coca-Cola Company responded to the emails with a statement saying that they \"consider it prudent to monitor for protest activities at any major event we sponsor\".[21]\n\n","Emails from Fred Burton (Stratfor’s Vice-President for Counterterrorism and Corporate Security, and former Deputy Chief of the Department of State\n) reveal a United States Government secret indictment against WikiLeaks\nfounder Julian Assange\n.[22]\n\n","Other emails cast doubt on the rape allegations against Assange.[23]\n\n","Around midnight on February 27, Stratfor released a statement saying that \"the release of its stolen emails was an attempt to silence and intimidate it.\" It also dismissed rumors of CEO George Friedman's resignation.[5]\n\n","Stratfor stated that some of the leaked emails \"may be forged or altered to include inaccuracies; some may be authentic\", but that they would not confirm either possibility. They further stated that the emails represented candid internal language that would probably be ripe for misinterpretation.[5]\n\n","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\ntold Reuters\nthat his concerns with Stratfor stem from it being a private intelligence firm relying on informants from government agencies with dubious reputations, both from the U.S. and abroad, and especially its targeting of activist organizations.[5]\n\nHe also called the company a \"shadow CIA\" and stated that the emails would \"reveal Stratfor's web of informers, payoff structure, payment-laundering techniques and psychological methods.\"[24]\n\n","Former NSA\nDirector Bobby Inman\nstated that the leak would be damaging to Stratfor's business. He had previously stated that Stratfor was competent, delivering high-quality intelligence analyses.[21]\n\n","Max Fisher, the associate director of The Atlantic\n\n, argued that Stratfor has a poor reputation \"among foreign policy writers, analysts, and practitioners\" and that as a result Anonymous and Wikileaks have exaggerated the significance of the information they released. He also suggested that Assange may have targeted a relatively unimportant firm and over-hyped the results in order to \"regain some of his former glory\".[25]\n\nAustralian Broadcasting Corporation\nforeign correspondent and Stratfor subscriber Mark Corcoran also wrote that the e-mails showed Stratfor's methods used to gather information are similar to those employed by journalists, though he wrote that the quality of its reports are often inferior to news reports.[26]\n\n"],"title":"2012–13 Stratfor email

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df2e0262df3aa1b2f579"},"content":{"contents":["Snapchat\nis an image messaging\nand multimedia\nmobile application\ncreated by Evan Spiegel\n, Bobby Murphy\n, and Reggie Brown,[6]\n\nformer students at Stanford University\n, and developed by Snap Inc.\n, originally Snapchat Inc.","One of the principal concepts of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are only available for a short time before they become inaccessible\n. The app has evolved from originally focusing on person-to-person photo sharing to presently featuring \"Stories\" of 24-hour chronological content, along with \"Discover\" to let brands show ad-supported short-form entertainment. Snapchat has become notable for representing a new, mobile-first direction for social media, and places significant emphasis on users interacting with virtual stickers and augmented reality\nobjects. As of February 2018, Snapchat has 187\u0026#160;million daily active users.[7]\n\n[8]\n\n","","","According to documents and deposition\nstatements, Reggie Brown brought the idea for a disappearing pictures application to Evan Spiegel\nbecause Spiegel had prior business experience. Brown and Spiegel then pulled in Bobby Murphy\n, who had experience coding\n. The three worked closely together for several months, and launched Snapchat as \"Picaboo\" on the iOS\noperating system on July 8, 2011.[9]\n\n[10]\n\nSpiegel and Murphy then decided to \"toss Brown out of the company\".[11]\n\n","The app was relaunched as Snapchat in September 2011, and the team focused on usability and technical aspects, rather than branding efforts.[12]\n\nOne exception was the decision to keep a mascot designed by Brown, \"Ghostface Chillah\", named after Ghostface Killah\nof the hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan\n.[12]\n\n","On May 8, 2012, Reggie Brown sent an email to Evan Spiegel during their senior year at Stanford in which he offered to re-negotiate his equitable share regarding ownership of the company. Lawyers for Snapchat responded by insisting that he had never had any creative connection to the product. The attorneys also accused Brown of committing fraud\nagainst Spiegel and Murphy by falsely claiming to be a product inventor. On behalf of their clients, the law firm concluded that Reggie Brown\nhad made no contributions of value or worth, and was therefore entitled to a share of nothing.[13]\n\n[14]\n\nIn September 2014, Brown settled with Spiegel and Murphy for $157.5 million[15]\n\nand for getting credited as one of the original authors of Snapchat.[6]\n\n[16]\n\n[17]\n\n","In their first blog post, dated May 9, 2012, CEO\nEvan Spiegel described the company's mission: \"Snapchat isn’t about capturing the traditional Kodak\nmoment. It’s about communicating with the full range of human emotion — not just what appears to be pretty or perfect.\"reference\"\u003e\u003e\nHe presented Snapchat as the solution to stresses caused by the longevity of personal information on social media, evidenced by \"emergency detagging of Facebook\nphotos before job interviews and photoshopping\nblemishes out of candid shots before they hit the internet\".id=\"cite_ref-let's_chat_18-1\" class=\"reference\"\u003eref=\"#cite_note-let's_chat-18\"\u003e[18]\n\n\nGrowth\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld map indicating Snapchat's core users by country in 2014. Map based on data from a report from Business Insider\nIntelligence.[19]\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2012, 25 images were being sent per second[20]\n\nand, as of November 28, 2012, users had shared over one billion photos on the Snapchat iOS app, with 20 million photos being shared per day.[20]\n\n[21]\n\nIn November 2012, Spiegel cited problems with userbase scalability\nas the reason why Snapchat was experiencing some difficulties delivering its images, known as \"snaps\", in real time\n.[20]\n\nSnapchat was released as an Android\napp on October 29, 2012.[20]\n\n\nIn June 2013, Snapchat version 5.0, dubbed \"Banquo\n\", was released for iOS. The updated version introduced several speed and design enhancements, including swipe navigation, double-tap to reply, an improved friend finder, and in-app profiles.[22]\n\nThe name is a reference to the ghostly hero from Shakespeare's Macbeth\n, a character in the play who is ultimately seen to be victorious over evil.[23]\n\nAlso in June 2013, Snapchat introduced Snapkidz for users under 13 years of age. Snapkidz was part of the original Snapchat application and was activated when the user provided a date of birth to verify his/her age. Snapkidz allowed children to take snaps and draw on them, but they could not send snaps to other users and could only save snaps locally on the device being used.[24]\n\n\nAccording to Snapchat's published statistics, as of May 2015, the app's users were sending 2 billion videos per day, reaching 6 billion by November.[25]\n\nBy 2016, Snapchat had hit 10 billion daily video views.[26]\n\nIn May 2016, Snapchat raised $1.81 billion in equity offering, suggesting strong investor interest in the company.[27]\n\nBy May 31, 2016, the app had almost 10 million daily active users in the United Kingdom.[28]\n\nIn February 2017, Snapchat had 160\u0026#160;million daily active users,[29]\n\n[30]\n\ngrowing to 166\u0026#160;million in May.[31]\n\n[32]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapchat Spectacles Vending Machine at SXSW 2017, Austin, Texas\n\n\nIn September 2016, Snapchat Inc. was renamed Snap Inc.\n, along with the introduction of the company's first hardware\ngadget, Spectacles\n, a pair of smartglasses\nwith a built-in camera that can record 10 seconds of video at a time.[33]\n\nOn February 20, 2017, Spectacles became available for purchase online.[34]\n\n\nFeatures\n\nCore functionality\n\nSnapchat is primarily used for creating multimedia messages referred to as \"snaps\"; snaps can consist of a photo or a short video, and can be edited to include filters and effects, text captions, and drawings.[35]\n\n[36]\n\nThe ability to send video snaps was added as a feature option in December 2012. By holding down on the photo button while inside the app, a video of up to ten seconds in length can be captured. After a single viewing, the video disappears by default. Spiegel explained that this process allowed the video data to be compressed into the size of a photo.[37]\n\nOn May 1, 2014, the ability to communicate via video chat\nwas added. Direct messaging features were also included in the update, allowing users to send ephemeral\ntext messages to friends and family while saving any needed information by clicking on it.[38]\n\n[39]\n\n\nA feature known as \"Geofilters\" was added in July 2014, which allows special graphical overlays to be available if the user is within a certain geographical location\n, such as a city, event, or destination.[40]\n\n[41]\n\nSnapchat users can design and submit their own \"Geofilters\" to be used on the app. The \"Lens\" feature, introduced in September 2015, allows users to add real-time effects into their snaps by using face detection\ntechnology. This is activated by long-pressing on a face within the viewfinder.[42]\n\nIn April 2017, Snapchat extended this feature into \"World Lenses\", which use augmented reality\ntechnology to integrate 3D rendered\nelements (such as objects and animated characters) into scenes; these elements are placed and anchored in 3D space\n.[43]\n\n[44]\n\n\nSnaps can be directed privately to selected contacts, or to a semi-public \"Story\".[45]\n\nThe private message photo snaps can be viewed for a user-specified length of time (1 to 10 seconds as determined by the sender) before they become inaccessible. Users were previously required to hold down on the screen in order to view a snap; this behavior was removed in July 2015[46]\n\nThe requirement to hold on the screen was intended to frustrate the ability to take screenshots\nof snaps; the Snapchat app does not prevent screenshots from being taken, but can notify the sender if it detects that it has been saved. However, these notifications can be bypassed through either unauthorized modifications to the app or by obtaining the image through external means.[12]\n\n[20]\n\n[47]\n\nOne snap per day can be replayed for free.[48]\n\nIn September 2015, Snapchat introduced the option to purchase additional replays through in-app purchases\n.[49]\n\n[48]\n\n[50]\n\nThe ability to purchase extra replays was removed in April 2016.[51]\n\n[52]\n\n\nFriends can be added via usernames and phone contacts, using customizable \"Snapcodes\n\", or through the \"Add Nearby\" function, which scans for users near their location who are also in the Add Nearby menu.[46]\n\n[53]\n\nSpiegel explained that Snapchat is intended to counteract the trend of users being compelled to manage an idealized online identity\nof themselves, which he says has \"taken all of the fun out of communicating\".[12]\n\n\nIn November 2014, Snapchat introduced \"Snapcash\", a feature that lets users send and receive money to each other through private messaging. The payments system is powered by Square\n.[54]\n\n[55]\n\n\nIn July 2016, Snapchat introduced a new, optional feature known as \"Memories\". Memories allows snaps and story posts to be saved into a private storage area, where they can be viewed alongside other photos stored on the device, as well as edited and published as snaps, story posts, or messages. When shared to a user's current story, the memory would have a white frame and timestamp to indicate its age. Content in the Memories storage area can be searched by date or using a local object recognition\nsystem. Snaps accessible within Memories can additionally be placed into a \"My Eyes Only\" area that is locked with a PIN. Snapchat has stated that the Memories feature was inspired by the practice of manually scrolling through photos on a phone to show them to others.[56]\n\nIn April 2017, the white border around old memories was removed. While originally intended to let viewers know the material was old, TechCrunch\n\nwrote that the indicator \"ended up annoying users who didn’t want their snaps altered, sometimes to the point where they would decide not to share the old content at all\".[57]\n\n[58]\n\n\nJuly 2016 also marked Snapchat's acquisition of Bitstrips\nand its app Bitmoji, which allows users to design stickers\nfeaturing personalized cartoon avatars\n. At this time, Snapchat launched integration between Bitmoji and Snapchat, allowing users to link their accounts and use Bitmoji stickers within snaps and messages.[59]\n\n[60]\n\nBitmoji characters can also be used as World Lenses.[61]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Snapchat launched Geostickers, a feature that lets users send city-specific stickers in snaps and messages. Original launch cities were San Francisco\n(which launched with 15 stickers), Los Angeles\n, New York\n, Washington, D.C.\n, Honolulu\n, London\n, Sydney\n, São Paulo\n, Paris\nand Riyadh\n.[62]\n\n\nIn May 2017, an update made it possible to send snaps with unlimited viewing time, dropping the previous ten-second maximum duration, with the content disappearing after being deliberately closed by the recipient. New creative tools, namely the ability to draw with an emoji, videos that play in a loop, and an eraser that lets users remove objects in a photo with the app filling in the space with the background, were also released.[63]\n\n[64]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Snapchat started allowing users to add links to snaps, enabling them to direct viewers to specific websites; the feature was only available for brands previously. Additionally, the update added more creative tools: A \"Backdrop\" feature lets users cut out a specific object from their photo and apply colorful patterns to it in order to bring greater emphasis to that object, and \"Voice Filters\" enable users to remix the sounds of their voices in the snap. Voice Filters was previously available as part of the feature enabling augmented reality lenses, with the new update adding a dedicated speaker icon to remix the audio in any snap.[65]\n\n[66]\n\n\nFriend Emojis\n\nAs incentive to send content regularly, emoji icons will appear next to the names of contacts that the user frequently interacts with.[67]\n\n\nEmoji\nFriend Emoji Name\nSnapchat Meaning\n\n💕\nSuper BFF\nAppears next to your #1 Best Friend when you're also their #1 Best Friend - for two months in a row.\n\n❤️\nBFF\nAppears next to your #1 Best Friend when you're also their #1 Best Friend - for two weeks in a row.\n\n💛\nBesties\nAppears next to your #1 Best Friend when you're also their #1 Best Friend.\n\n😊\nBFs\nAppears next to one of your Best Friends\n\n😏\nTheir BF, but...\nAppears next to someone when you are one of their Best Friends, but they are not one of yours.\n\n😬\nMutual Besties\nAppears next to someone when your #1 Best Friend is also their #1 Best Friend.\n\n😎\nMutual BFs\nAppears next to someone whom you share a best friend with.\n\n🔥\nSnapstreak\nAppears next to the number of days that you and a friend have Snapped each other.

Send each other a Snap, not a chat, to keep your streak alive\n\n🎂\nBirthday Cake\nAppears next to someone when it is their birthday.\n\n\nStories and Discover\n\nIn October 2013, Snapchat introduced the \"My Story\" feature, which allows users to compile snaps into chronological storylines, accessible to all of their friends.[45]\n\n[68]\n\nBy June 2014, photo and video snaps presented to friends in the Stories functionality had surpassed person-to-person private snaps as the most frequently-used function of the service, with over one billion viewed per day — double the daily views tallied in April 2014.[69]\n\n\nIn June 2014, the story feature was expanded to incorporate \"Our Stories\", which was then changed to \"Live Stories\" about a year later. The feature allows users on-location at specific events (such as music festivals\nor sporting events) to contribute snaps to a curated story advertised to all users, showcasing a single event from multiple perspectives and viewpoints. These curated snaps provided by the app's contributors and selected for the \"Live\" section could also be more localized, but Snapchat eventually scaled back the more personal imaging streams in order to emphasize public events.[70]\n\n[71]\n\n[72]\n\n[73]\n\n[74]\n\n[75]\n\n\nAn \"Official Stories\" designation was added in November 2015 to denote the public stories of notable figures and celebrities, similar to Twitter\n's \"Verified account\" program.[76]\n\n\nIn January 2015, Snapchat introduced \"Discover\", an area containing channels of ad-supported short-form content from major publishers, including BuzzFeed\n, CNN\n, ESPN\n, Mashable\n, People\n\n, Vice\nand Snapchat\nitself among others.[77]\n\n[78]\n\n[79]\n\nTo address data usage concerns related to these functions, a \"Travel Mode\" option was added in August 2015. When activated, the feature prevents the automatic downloading of snaps until they are explicitly requested by the user.[80]\n\n\nIn October 2016, the app was updated to replace its auto-advance functionality, which automatically moved users from one story to the next, with a \"Story Playlist\" feature, letting users select thumbnails of users in the list to play only selected stories.[81]\n\n[82]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Snapchat revamped its design, adding search functionality and a new global live \"Our Story\" feature, to which any user can contribute.[83]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Snapchat introduced \"Custom Stories\", letting users collaboratively make stories combining their captures.[84]\n\n[85]\n\n\nIn June 2017, \"Snap Map\" was introduced, which allows users to optionally share their location with friends. A map display, accessible from the viewfinder, can be used to locate stories based on location data, supporting the use of Bitmoji as placemarkers. Entering a \"Ghost Mode\" hides the user from the map.[86]\n\n[87]\n\nThe function is based on the app Zenly, which was acquired by Snap Inc. prior to its launch.[88]\n\nThe map data is supplied from OpenStreetMap\nand Mapbox\n, while satellite imagery comes from DigitalGlobe\n.[89]\n\n\nOriginal video content\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nreported in May 2017 that Snap Inc.\n, the company developing Snapchat, had signed deals with NBCUniversal\n, A\u0026amp;E Networks\n, BBC\n, ABC\n, Metro–Goldwyn–Mayer\nand other content producers to develop original shows for viewing through Snapchat's \"Stories\" format. According to the report, Snap hopes to have several new shows available on a daily basis, with each show lasting between three and five minutes, and the company has sent out detailed reports to its partners on how to produce content for Snapchat.[90]\n\n[91]\n\n[92]\n\n\nMessaging\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Snapchat \"snap\" on smartphone.\n\n\nIn contrast to other messaging apps, Spiegel described Snapchat's messaging functions as being \"conversational,\" rather than \"transactional,\" as they sought to replicate the conversations he engaged in with friends. Spiegel stated that he did not experience conversational interactions while using the products of competitors like iMessage\n.[38]\n\n\nRather than a traditional online notification, a blue pulsing \"Here\" button is displayed within the sender's chat window if the recipient is currently viewing their own chat window. When this button is held down, a video chat function is immediately launched.[38]\n\nBy default, messages disappear after they are read, and a notification is sent to the recipient only when they start to type.[38]\n\nUsers can also use messages to reply to snaps that are part of a story.[93]\n\nThe video chat feature uses technology from AddLive—a real-time communications provider that Snapchat acquired prior to the feature's launch.[94]\n\nIn regards to the \"Here\" indicator, Spiegel explained that \"the accepted notion of an online indicator that every chat service has is really a negative indicator. It means 'my friend is available and doesn't want to talk to you,' versus this idea in Snapchat where 'my friend is here and is giving you their full attention.'\" Spiegel further claimed that the Here video function prevents the awkwardness that can arise from apps that use typing indicators because, with text communication, conversations lose their fluidity as each user tries to avoid typing at the same time.[38]\n\n\nOn March 29, 2016, Snapchat launched a major revision of the messaging functionality known as \"Chat 2.0\", adding stickers, easier access to audio and video conferencing, the ability to leave audio or video \"notes\", and the ability to share recent camera photos. The implementation of these features are meant to allow users to easily shift between text, audio, and video chat as needed while retaining an equal level of functionality.[95]\n\n\nBusiness and multimedia\n\nDemographics\n\nFrom its earliest days, Snapchat's main demographic has consisted of millennials\n.[96]\n\nIn 2014, researchers from the University of Washington\nand Seattle Pacific University\ndesigned a user survey to help understand how and why the application was being used. The researchers originally hypothesized that due to the ephemeral nature of Snapchat messages, its use would be predominantly for privacy-sensitive content including the much talked about potential use for sexual content and sexting\n.[97]\n\nHowever, it appears that Snapchat is used for a variety of creative purposes that are not necessarily privacy-related at all.[97]\n\nIn the study, only 1.6% of respondents reported using Snapchat primarily for sexting, although 14.2% admitted to having sent sexual content via Snapchat at some point.[97]\n\nThese findings suggest that users do not seem to utilize Snapchat for sensitive content. Rather, the primary use for Snapchat was found to be for comedic content such as \"stupid faces\" with 59.8% of respondents reporting this use most commonly.[97]\n\nThe researchers also determined how Snapchat users do not use the application and what types of content they are not willing to send. They found that the majority of users are not willing to send content classified as sexting (74.8% of respondents), photos of documents (85.0% of respondents), messages containing legally questionable content (86.6% of respondents), or content considered mean or insulting (93.7% of respondents).[97]\n\n\nThe study results also suggested that Snapchat's success is not due to its security properties, but because the users found the application to be fun. The researchers found that users seem to be well aware (79.4% of respondents) that recovering snaps is possible and a majority of users (52.8% of respondents) report that this does not affect their behavior and use of Snapchat.[97]\n\nMost users (52.8% of respondents) were found to use an arbitrary timeout length on snaps regardless of the content type or recipient. The remaining respondents were found to adjust their snaps' timeout depending on the content or the recipient.[97]\n\nReasons for adjusting the time length of snaps included the level of trust and relationship with the recipient, the time needed to comprehend the snap, and avoiding screenshots\n.[97]\n\n\nCommunication\n\nSnapchat has often been seen to represent a new direction in social media, with its users, particularly millennials, craving a more in-the-moment way of sharing and communicating via technology. With less emphasis on the accumulation of an ongoing status involving the presence of permanent material, Snapchat put focus on the ephemeral nature of fleeting encounters.[98]\n\nBuilding on this distinction by launching as a mobile-first company, Snapchat, in the midst of the app revolution and the growing presence of cellular communication, didn't have to make the transition to mobile in the way other competing social media networks had to do. Evan Spiegel himself described Snapchat as primarily a camera company.[99]\n\n[100]\n\nSpiegel also dismissed past comparisons to other social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter when he was asked if the 2016 presidential race was going to be remembered as the Snapchat election, although major candidates did occasionally use the app to reach voters.[101]\n\nNevertheless, the growing mobile app moved to offer distinct publication, media, and news content within its Discover channel, as well as with its overall style of presentation. With Snapchat, a clear and identifiable line was drawn between brand content and user based messaging and sharing, once again distinguishing the popular app from other social media networks, which typically have blended and blurred their different varieties of content.[102]\n\n\nMonetization\n\nSnapchat's developing features embody a deliberate strategy of monetization\n.\nSnapchat announced its then-upcoming advertising efforts on October 17, 2014, when it acknowledged its need for a revenue stream.[103]\n\nThe company stated that it wanted to evaluate \"if we can deliver an experience that's fun and informative, the way ads used to be, before they got creepy and targeted.\"[104]\n\nSnapchat's first paid advertisement, in the form of a 20-second movie trailer for the horror film Ouija\n\n, was shown to users on October 19, 2014.[105]\n\n[106]\n\n\nThe \"Discover\" feature, which presents short-form content from publishers, allows for paid advertising. The entity that sells the ad campaign causes the revenue distribution between Snapchat and its partner to vary, but it is estimated that advertisements are worth ten to fifteen cents per view. Furthermore, advertisements are estimated to be seen 500,000 to 1,000,000 times a day.[78]\n\n[79]\n\n[107]\n\n\nIn June 2015, Snapchat announced that it would allow advertisers to purchase sponsored geofilters for snaps; an early customer of the offering was , who paid for a branded geofilter covering its restaurant locations in the United States.[40]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advertising of Snapchat's \"ghost\" logo at Times Square\nin New York City\nin April 2016.\n\n\nIn October 2015, Snapchat started working with companies to create sponsored Lens filters.[108]\n\nIn May 2016, as part of a campaign to promote X-Men: Apocalypse\n\n, 20th Century Fox\npaid for the entire array of lenses to be replaced by those based on characters from the X-Men\n\nseries and films for a single day.[109]\n\n\nAd placements can be sold within a live story, or a story can be pitched by a sponsor. Live stories are estimated to reach an average of 20 million viewers in a 24-hour span.[73]\n\nIn September 2015, the service entered into a partnership with the National Football League\nto present live stories from selected games (including a Sunday game, and marquee games such as Monday Night Football\nand Thursday Night Football\n), with both parties contributing content and handling ad sales.[73]\n\n[110]\n\n\nMary Meeker, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield \u0026amp; Byers\n, which negotiated a financial agreement with Snapchat in August 2014,[111]\n\nhighlighted the growth of vertical video\nviewing in her 2015 Internet Trends Report – growing from 5% of video viewing in 2010 to 29% in 2015. Vertical video ads like Snapchat's are watched in their entirety nine times more than landscape video ads.[112]\n\n\nIn April 2016, NBC Olympics\nannounced that it had reached a deal with Snapchat to allow stories from the 2016 Summer Olympics\nto be featured on Snapchat in the United States. The content will include a behind-the-scenes Discover channel curated by BuzzFeed\n(a company which NBCUniversal\nhas funded), and stories featuring a combination of footage from NBC, athletes, and attendees. NBC will sell advertising and enter into revenue sharing agreements. This marks the first time NBC has allowed Olympics footage to be featured on third-party property.[113]\n\n\nIn July 2016, it was reported that Snapchat had submitted a patent\napplication for the process of using an object recognition system to deliver sponsored filters based on objects seen in a camera view.[114]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Digiday\n\nreported that Snapchat would launch a self-service manager for advertising on the platform.[115]\n\nThe feature launched the following month, alongside news of a Snapchat Mobile Dashboard for tracking ad campaigns, set to roll out in June to select countries.[116]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Snapchat introduced a \"Snap to Store\" advertising tool that lets companies using geostickers to track whether users buy their product or visit their store in a 7-day period after seeing the relevant geosticker.[117]\n\n[118]\n\n\n\nControversy\n\nDecember 2013 hack\n\nSnapchat was hacked on December 31, 2013.[119]\n\n[120]\n\nGibson Security, an Australian security firm, had disclosed an API security vulnerability to the company on August 27, 2013,[121]\n\n[122]\n\nand then made public the source code for the exploit on Christmas Day (Australian time; Christmas Eve in the US).[123]\n\n[124]\n\nOn December 27, Snapchat announced that it had implemented mitigating features.[125]\n\nNonetheless, an anonymous group hacked them, saying that the mitigating features presented only \"minor obstacles\".[126]\n\n[127]\n\nThe hackers revealed parts of approximately 4.6\u0026#160;million Snapchat usernames and phone numbers on a website named \"SnapchatDB.info\"[120]\n\n[128]\n\n[129]\n\nand sent a statement to the popular technology blog TechCrunch\n\nsaying that their objective had been to \"raise public awareness\u0026#160;... and\u0026#160;... put public pressure on Snapchat\" to fix the vulnerability.[128]\n\nSnapchat apologized a week after the hack.[130]\n\n\nFederal Trade Commission\n\nIn 2014, Snapchat settled a complaint made by the Federal Trade Commission\n. The government agency alleged that the company had exaggerated to the public the degree to which mobile app images and photos could actually be made to disappear. Under the terms of the agreement, Snapchat was not fined, but the app service agreed to have its claims and policies monitored by an independent party for a period of 20 years. The FTC concluded that Snapchat was prohibited from \"misrepresenting the extent to which it maintains the privacy, security, or confidentiality of users' information.\"[131]\n\n\nFollowing the agreement, Snapchat updated its privacy page to state that the company \"can't guarantee that messages will be deleted within a specific timeframe.\" [132]\n\nEven after Snapchat deletes message data from their servers, that same data may remain in backup for a certain period of time.[132]\n\nIn a public blog post, the service warned that \"If you've ever tried to recover lost data after accidentally deleting a drive or maybe watched an episode of CSI\n\n, you might know that with the right forensic tools, it's sometimes possible to retrieve data after it has been deleted.\"[133]\n\n\nLens incidents\n\nIn September 2015, an 18-year-old was using a Snapchat feature called \"Lens\" to record the speed she was driving her Mercedes C230 when she crashed into a Mitsubishi Outlander in Hampton, Georgia. The 107\u0026#160;mph (172\u0026#160;km/h) crash injured both drivers. The driver of the Outlander spent five weeks in intensive care\nwhile he was treated for severe traumatic brain injury\n. In April 2016, the Outlander driver sued both Snapchat and the user of Snapchat, alleging that Snapchat knew its application was being used in unlawful speed contests, yet did nothing to prevent such use so is negligent.[134]\n\n\nA similar collision while driving at 115\u0026#160;mph (185\u0026#160;km/h), occurred in Tampa, Florida in October 2016 that killed five people.[135]\n\n\nPatent infringement\n\nIn 2016, Snapchat was sued by Canadian company Investel for infringement on its geofiltering patent.[136]\n\n[137]\n\n\n\n\"Poor Country\" remark\n\nAccording to former Snapchat employee Anthony Pompliano in a lawsuit filed against Snap Inc.,\u0026#160;Spiegel made a statement in 2015 that Snapchat is \"only for rich people\" and that he does not \"want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain\".[138]\n\nThe incident sparked a Twitter trend\ncalled \"#UninstallSnapchat\", in which Indian users uninstalled the app,[139]\n\nand caused backlash against the company in terms of low \"one-star\" ratings for the app in the Google Play\nstore and Apple\n's App Store\n.[140]\n\n[141]\n\nSnapchat's shares fell by 1.5%.[142]\n\nIn response to the allegation, Snapchat called Pompliano's claim \"ridiculous\", and elaborated that \"Obviously Snapchat is for everyone. It’s available worldwide to download for free\".[141]\n\n\n\n\"Snap Map\" privacy concerns\n\nThe June 2017 release of \"Snap Map\", a feature that broadcasts the user's location on a map, was met with concerns over privacy and safety. The feature, though opt-in, delivers a message asking if the user would like to show their position on the map, but reportedly doesn't explain the ramifications of doing so, including that the app updates the user's position on the map each time the app is opened and not just when actively capturing snaps, potentially allowing for stalkers. The map can be zoomed in to feature detailed geographical information, such as street addresses.[143]\n\nThe Daily Telegraph\n\nreported that police forces had issued child safety warnings,[144]\n\nwhile other media publications wrote that safety concerns were also raised for teenagers and adults unaware of the feature's actual behavior.[143]\n\n[145]\n\nIn a statement to The Verge\n\n, a Snapchat spokesperson said that \"The safety of our community is very important to us and we want to make sure that all Snapchatters, parents, and educators have accurate information about how the Snap Map works\".[143]\n\n\nSee also\n\nComparison of instant messaging clients\n\nEphemera\n– any transitory written or printed matter not meant to be retained or preserved\nList of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users\n\nTimeline of social media\n\nSobrr\n, another mobile application which deletes content after a specified time\n\nReferences\n\n^\n\n\n\"Snapchat - Android Apps on Google Play\"\n.

The updated version introduced several speed and design enhancements, including swipe navigation, double-tap to reply, an improved friend finder, and in-app profiles.[22]\n\nThe name is a reference to the ghostly hero from Shakespeare's Macbeth\n, a character in the play who is ultimately seen to be victorious over evil.[23]\n\nAlso in June 2013, Snapchat introduced Snapkidz for users under 13 years of age. Snapkidz was part of the original Snapchat application and was activated when the user provided a date of birth to verify his/her age. Snapkidz allowed children to take snaps and draw on them, but they could not send snaps to other users and could only save snaps locally on the device being used.[24]\n\n","According to Snapchat's published statistics, as of May 2015, the app's users were sending 2 billion videos per day, reaching 6 billion by November.[25]\n\nBy 2016, Snapchat had hit 10 billion daily video views.[26]\n\nIn May 2016, Snapchat raised $1.81 billion in equity offering, suggesting strong investor interest in the company.[27]\n\nBy May 31, 2016, the app had almost 10 million daily active users in the United Kingdom.[28]\n\nIn February 2017, Snapchat had 160\u0026#160;million daily active users,[29]\n\n[30]\n\ngrowing to 166\u0026#160;million in May.[31]\n\n[32]\n\n","In September 2016, Snapchat Inc. was renamed Snap Inc.\n, along with the introduction of the company's first hardware\ngadget, Spectacles\n, a pair of smartglasses\nwith a built-in camera that can record 10 seconds of video at a time.[33]\n\nOn February 20, 2017, Spectacles became available for purchase online.[34]\n\n","Snapchat is primarily used for creating multimedia messages referred to as \"snaps\"; snaps can consist of a photo or a short video, and can be edited to include filters and effects, text captions, and drawings.[35]\n\n[36]\n\nThe ability to send video snaps was added as a feature option in December 2012. By holding down on the photo button while inside the app, a video of up to ten seconds in length can be captured. After a single viewing, the video disappears by default. Spiegel explained that this process allowed the video data to be compressed into the size of a photo.[37]\n\nOn May 1, 2014, the ability to communicate via video chat\nwas added. Direct messaging features were also included in the update, allowing users to send ephemeral\ntext messages to friends and family while saving any needed information by clicking on it.[38]\n\n[39]\n\n","A feature known as \"Geofilters\" was added in July 2014, which allows special graphical overlays to be available if the user is within a certain geographical location\n, such as a city, event, or destination.[40]\n\n[41]\n\nSnapchat users can design and submit their own \"Geofilters\" to be used on the app. The \"Lens\" feature, introduced in September 2015, allows users to add real-time effects into their snaps by using face detection\ntechnology. This is activated by long-pressing on a face within the viewfinder.[42]\n\nIn April 2017, Snapchat extended this feature into \"World Lenses\", which use augmented reality\ntechnology to integrate 3D rendered\nelements (such as objects and animated characters) into scenes; these elements are placed and anchored in 3D space\n.[43]\n\n[44]\n\n","Snaps can be directed privately to selected contacts, or to a semi-public \"Story\".[45]\n\nThe private message photo snaps can be viewed for a user-specified length of time (1 to 10 seconds as determined by the sender) before they become inaccessible. Users were previously required to hold down on the screen in order to view a snap; this behavior was removed in July 2015[46]\n\nThe requirement to hold on the screen was intended to frustrate the ability to take screenshots\nof snaps; the Snapchat app does not prevent screenshots from being taken, but can notify the sender if it detects that it has been saved. However, these notifications can be bypassed through either unauthorized modifications to the app or by obtaining the image through external means.[12]\n\n[20]\n\n[47]\n\nOne snap per day can be replayed for free.[48]\n\nIn September 2015, Snapchat introduced the option to purchase additional replays through in-app purchases\n.[49]\n\n[48]\n\n[50]\n\nThe ability to purchase extra replays was removed in April 2016.[51]\n\n[52]\n\n","Friends can be added via usernames and phone contacts, using customizable \"Snapcodes\n\", or through the \"Add Nearby\" function, which scans for users near their location who are also in the Add Nearby menu.[46]\n\n[53]\n\nSpiegel explained that Snapchat is intended to counteract the trend of users being compelled to manage an idealized online identity\nof themselves, which he says has \"taken all of the fun out of communicating\".[12]\n\n","In November 2014, Snapchat introduced \"Snapcash\", a feature that lets users send and receive money to each other through private messaging. The payments system is powered by Square\n.[54]\n\n[55]\n\n","In July 2016, Snapchat introduced a new, optional feature known as \"Memories\". Memories allows snaps and story posts to be saved into a private storage area, where they can be viewed alongside other photos stored on the device, as well as edited and published as snaps, story posts, or messages. When shared to a user's current story, the memory would have a white frame and timestamp to indicate its age. Content in the Memories storage area can be searched by date or using a local object recognition\nsystem. Snaps accessible within Memories can additionally be placed into a \"My Eyes Only\" area that is locked with a PIN. Snapchat has stated that the Memories feature was inspired by the practice of manually scrolling through photos on a phone to show them to others.[56]\n\nIn April 2017, the white border around old memories was removed. While originally intended to let viewers know the material was old, TechCrunch\n\nwrote that the indicator \"ended up annoying users who didn’t want their snaps altered, sometimes to the point where they would decide not to share the old content at all\".[57]\n\n[58]\n\n","July 2016 also marked Snapchat's acquisition of Bitstrips\nand its app Bitmoji, which allows users to design stickers\nfeaturing personalized cartoon avatars\n. At this time, Snapchat launched integration between Bitmoji and Snapchat, allowing users to link their accounts and use Bitmoji stickers within snaps and messages.[59]\n\n[60]\n\nBitmoji characters can also be used as World Lenses.[61]\n\n","In August 2016, Snapchat launched Geostickers, a feature that lets users send city-specific stickers in snaps and messages. Original launch cities were San Francisco\n(which launched with 15 stickers), Los Angeles\n, New York\n, Washington, D.C.\n, Honolulu\n, London\n, Sydney\n, São Paulo\n, Paris\nand Riyadh\n.[62]\n\n","In May 2017, an update made it possible to send snaps with unlimited viewing time, dropping the previous ten-second maximum duration, with the content disappearing after being deliberately closed by the recipient. New creative tools, namely the ability to draw with an emoji, videos that play in a loop, and an eraser that lets users remove objects in a photo with the app filling in the space with the background, were also released.[63]\n\n[64]\n\n","In June 2017, Snapchat started allowing users to add links to snaps, enabling them to direct viewers to specific websites; the feature was only available for brands previously. Additionally, the update added more creative tools: A \"Backdrop\" feature lets users cut out a specific object from their photo and apply colorful patterns to it in order to bring greater emphasis to that object, and \"Voice Filters\" enable users to remix the sounds of their voices in the snap. Voice Filters was previously available as part of the feature enabling augmented reality lenses, with the new update adding a dedicated speaker icon to remix the audio in any snap.[65]\n\n[66]\n\n","In October 2013, Snapchat introduced the \"My Story\" feature, which allows users to compile snaps into chronological storylines, accessible to all of their friends.[45]\n\n[68]\n\nBy June 2014, photo and video snaps presented to friends in the Stories functionality had surpassed person-to-person private snaps as the most frequently-used function of the service, with over one billion viewed per day — double the daily views tallied in April 2014.[69]\n\n","In June 2014, the story feature was expanded to incorporate \"Our Stories\", which was then changed to \"Live Stories\" about a year later. The feature allows users on-location at specific events (such as music festivals\nor sporting events) to contribute snaps to a curated story advertised to all users, showcasing a single event from multiple perspectives and viewpoints. These curated snaps provided by the app's contributors and selected for the \"Live\" section could also be more localized, but Snapchat eventually scaled back the more personal imaging streams in order to emphasize public events.[70]\n\n[71]\n\n[72]\n\n[73]\n\n[74]\n\n[75]\n\n","An \"Official Stories\" designation was added in November 2015 to denote the public stories of notable figures and celebrities, similar to Twitter\n's \"Verified account\" program.[76]\n\n","In January 2015, Snapchat introduced \"Discover\", an area containing channels of ad-supported short-form content from major publishers, including BuzzFeed\n, CNN\n, ESPN\n, Mashable\n, People\n\n, Vice\nand Snapchat\nitself among others.[77]\n\n[78]\n\n[79]\n\nTo address data usage concerns related to these functions, a \"Travel Mode\" option was added in August 2015. When activated, the feature prevents the automatic downloading of snaps until they are explicitly requested by the user.[80]\n\n","In October 2016, the app was updated to replace its auto-advance functionality, which automatically moved users from one story to the next, with a \"Story Playlist\" feature, letting users select thumbnails of users in the list to play only selected stories.[81]\n\n[82]\n\n","In January 2017, Snapchat revamped its design, adding search functionality and a new global live \"Our Story\" feature, to which any user can contribute.[83]\n\n","In May 2017, Snapchat introduced \"Custom Stories\", letting users collaboratively make stories combining their captures.[84]\n\n[85]\n\n","In June 2017, \"Snap Map\" was introduced, which allows users to optionally share their location with friends. A map display, accessible from the viewfinder, can be used to locate stories based on location data, supporting the use of Bitmoji as placemarkers. Entering a \"Ghost Mode\" hides the user from the map.[86]\n\n[87]\n\nThe function is based on the app Zenly, which was acquired by Snap Inc. prior to its launch.[88]\n\nThe map data is supplied from OpenStreetMap\nand Mapbox\n, while satellite imagery comes from DigitalGlobe\n.[89]\n\n","The Wall Street Journal\n\nreported in May 2017 that Snap Inc.\n, the company developing Snapchat, had signed deals with NBCUniversal\n, A\u0026amp;E Networks\n, BBC\n, ABC\n, Metro–Goldwyn–Mayer\nand other content producers to develop original shows for viewing through Snapchat's \"Stories\" format. According to the report, Snap hopes to have several new shows available on a daily basis, with each show lasting between three and five minutes, and the company has sent out detailed reports to its partners on how to produce content for Snapchat.[90]\n\n[91]\n\n[92]\n\n","In contrast to other messaging apps, Spiegel described Snapchat's messaging functions as being \"conversational,\" rather than \"transactional,\" as they sought to replicate the conversations he engaged in with friends. Spiegel stated that he did not experience conversational interactions while using the products of competitors like iMessage\n.[38]\n\n","Rather than a traditional online notification, a blue pulsing \"Here\" button is displayed within the sender's chat window if the recipient is currently viewing their own chat window. When this button is held down, a video chat function is immediately launched.[38]\n\nBy default, messages disappear after they are read, and a notification is sent to the recipient only when they start to type.[38]\n\nUsers can also use messages to reply to snaps that are part of a story.[93]\n\nThe video chat feature uses technology from AddLive—a real-time communications provider that Snapchat acquired prior to the feature's launch.[94]\n\nIn regards to the \"Here\" indicator, Spiegel explained that \"the accepted notion of an online indicator that every chat service has is really a negative indicator. It means 'my friend is available and doesn't want to talk to you,' versus this idea in Snapchat where 'my friend is here and is giving you their full attention.'\" Spiegel further claimed that the Here video function prevents the awkwardness that can arise from apps that use typing indicators because, with text communication, conversations lose their fluidity as each user tries to avoid typing at the same time.[38]\n\n","On March 29, 2016, Snapchat launched a major revision of the messaging functionality known as \"Chat 2.0\", adding stickers, easier access to audio and video conferencing, the ability to leave audio or video \"notes\", and the ability to share recent camera photos. The implementation of these features are meant to allow users to easily shift between text, audio, and video chat as needed while retaining an equal level of functionality.[95]\n\n","From its earliest days, Snapchat's main demographic has consisted of millennials\n.[96]\n\nIn 2014, researchers from the University of Washington\nand Seattle Pacific University\ndesigned a user survey to help understand how and why the application was being used. The researchers originally hypothesized that due to the ephemeral nature of Snapchat messages, its use would be predominantly for privacy-sensitive content including the much talked about potential use for sexual content and sexting\n.[97]\n\nHowever, it appears that Snapchat is used for a variety of creative purposes that are not necessarily privacy-related at all.[97]\n\nIn the study, only 1.6% of respondents reported using Snapchat primarily for sexting, although 14.2% admitted to having sent sexual content via Snapchat at some point.[97]\n\nThese findings suggest that users do not seem to utilize Snapchat for sensitive content. Rather, the primary use for Snapchat was found to be for comedic content such as \"stupid faces\" with 59.8% of respondents reporting this use most commonly.[97]\n\nThe researchers also determined how Snapchat users do not use the application and what types of content they are not willing to send. They found that the majority of users are not willing to send content classified as sexting (74.8% of respondents), photos of documents (85.0% of respondents), messages containing legally questionable content (86.6% of respondents), or content considered mean or insulting (93.7% of respondents).[97]\n\n","The study results also suggested that Snapchat's success is not due to its security properties, but because the users found the application to be fun. The researchers found that users seem to be well aware (79.4% of respondents) that recovering snaps is possible and a majority of users (52.8% of respondents) report that this does not affect their behavior and use of Snapchat.[97]\n\nMost users (52.8% of respondents) were found to use an arbitrary timeout length on snaps regardless of the content type or recipient. The remaining respondents were found to adjust their snaps' timeout depending on the content or the recipient.[97]\n\nReasons for adjusting the time length of snaps included the level of trust and relationship with the recipient, the time needed to comprehend the snap, and avoiding screenshots\n.[97]\n\n","Snapchat has often been seen to represent a new direction in social media, with its users, particularly millennials, craving a more in-the-moment way of sharing and communicating via technology. With less emphasis on the accumulation of an ongoing status involving the presence of permanent material, Snapchat put focus on the ephemeral nature of fleeting encounters.[98]\n\nBuilding on this distinction by launching as a mobile-first company, Snapchat, in the midst of the app revolution and the growing presence of cellular communication, didn't have to make the transition to mobile in the way other competing social media networks had to do. Evan Spiegel himself described Snapchat as primarily a camera company.[99]\n\n[100]\n\nSpiegel also dismissed past comparisons to other social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter when he was asked if the 2016 presidential race was going to be remembered as the Snapchat election, although major candidates did occasionally use the app to reach voters.[101]\n\nNevertheless, the growing mobile app moved to offer distinct publication, media, and news content within its Discover channel, as well as with its overall style of presentation. With Snapchat, a clear and identifiable line was drawn between brand content and user based messaging and sharing, once again distinguishing the popular app from other social media networks, which typically have blended and blurred their different varieties of content.[102]\n\n","Snapchat's developing features embody a deliberate strategy of monetization\n.","Snapchat announced its then-upcoming advertising efforts on October 17, 2014, when it acknowledged its need for a revenue stream.[103]\n\nThe company stated that it wanted to evaluate \"if we can deliver an experience that's fun and informative, the way ads used to be, before they got creepy and targeted.\"[104]\n\nSnapchat's first paid advertisement, in the form of a 20-second movie trailer for the horror film Ouija\n\n, was shown to users on October 19, 2014.[105]\n\n[106]\n\n","The \"Discover\" feature, which presents short-form content from publishers, allows for paid advertising. The entity that sells the ad campaign causes the revenue distribution between Snapchat and its partner to vary, but it is estimated that advertisements are worth ten to fifteen cents per view. Furthermore, advertisements are estimated to be seen 500,000 to 1,000,000 times a day.[78]\n\n[79]\n\n[107]\n\n","In June 2015, Snapchat announced that it would allow advertisers to purchase sponsored geofilters for snaps; an early customer of the offering was , who paid for a branded geofilter covering its restaurant locations in the United States.[40]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advertising of Snapchat's \"ghost\" logo at Times Square\nin New York City\nin April 2016.\n\n\nIn October 2015, Snapchat started working with companies to create sponsored Lens filters.[108]\n\nIn May 2016, as part of a campaign to promote X-Men: Apocalypse\n\n, 20th Century Fox\npaid for the entire array of lenses to be replaced by those based on characters from the X-Men\n\nseries and films for a single day.[109]\n\n\nAd placements can be sold within a live story, or a story can be pitched by a sponsor. Live stories are estimated to reach an average of 20 million viewers in a 24-hour span.[73]\n\nIn September 2015, the service entered into a partnership with the National Football League\nto present live stories from selected games (including a Sunday game, and marquee games such as Monday Night Football\nand Thursday Night Football\n), with both parties contributing content and handling ad sales.[73]\n\n[110]\n\n\nMary Meeker, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield \u0026amp; Byers\n, which negotiated a financial agreement with Snapchat in August 2014,[111]\n\nhighlighted the growth of vertical video\nviewing in her 2015 Internet Trends Report – growing from 5% of video viewing in 2010 to 29% in 2015. Vertical video ads like Snapchat's are watched in their entirety nine times more than landscape video ads.[112]\n\n\nIn April 2016, NBC Olympics\nannounced that it had reached a deal with Snapchat to allow stories from the 2016 Summer Olympics\nto be featured on Snapchat in the United States. The content will include a behind-the-scenes Discover channel curated by BuzzFeed\n(a company which NBCUniversal\nhas funded), and stories featuring a combination of footage from NBC, athletes, and attendees. NBC will sell advertising and enter into revenue sharing agreements. This marks the first time NBC has allowed Olympics footage to be featured on third-party property.[113]\n\n\nIn July 2016, it was reported that Snapchat had submitted a patent\napplication for the process of using an object recognition system to deliver sponsored filters based on objects seen in a camera view.[114]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Digiday\n\nreported that Snapchat would launch a self-service manager for advertising on the platform.[115]\n\nThe feature launched the following month, alongside news of a Snapchat Mobile Dashboard for tracking ad campaigns, set to roll out in June to select countries.[116]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Snapchat introduced a \"Snap to Store\" advertising tool that lets companies using geostickers to track whether users buy their product or visit their store in a 7-day period after seeing the relevant geosticker.[117]\n\n[118]\n\n\n\nControversy\n\nDecember 2013 hack\n\nSnapchat was hacked on December 31, 2013.[119]\n\n[120]\n\nGibson Security, an Australian security firm, had disclosed an API security vulnerability to the company on August 27, 2013,[121]\n\n[122]\n\nand then made public the source code for the exploit on Christmas Day (Australian time; Christmas Eve in the US).[123]\n\n[124]\n\nOn December 27, Snapchat announced that it had implemented mitigating features.[125]\n\nNonetheless, an anonymous group hacked them, saying that the mitigating features presented only \"minor obstacles\".[126]\n\n[127]\n\nThe hackers revealed parts of approximately 4.6\u0026#160;million Snapchat usernames and phone numbers on a website named \"SnapchatDB.info\"[120]\n\n[128]\n\n[129]\n\nand sent a statement to the popular technology blog TechCrunch\n\nsaying that their objective had been to \"raise public awareness\u0026#160;... and\u0026#160;... put public pressure on Snapchat\" to fix the vulnerability.[128]\n\nSnapchat apologized a week after the hack.[130]\n\n\nFederal Trade Commission\n\nIn 2014, Snapchat settled a complaint made by the Federal Trade Commission\n. The government agency alleged that the company had exaggerated to the public the degree to which mobile app images and photos could actually be made to disappear. Under the terms of the agreement, Snapchat was not fined, but the app service agreed to have its claims and policies monitored by an independent party for a period of 20 years. The FTC concluded that Snapchat was prohibited from \"misrepresenting the extent to which it maintains the privacy, security, or confidentiality of users' information.\"[131]\n\n\nFollowing the agreement, Snapchat updated its privacy page to state that the company \"can't guarantee that messages will be deleted within a specific timeframe.\" [132]\n\nEven after Snapchat deletes message data from their servers, that same data may remain in backup for a certain period of time.[132]\n\nIn a public blog post, the service warned that \"If you've ever tried to recover lost data after accidentally deleting a drive or maybe watched an episode of CSI\n\n, you might know that with the right forensic tools, it's sometimes possible to retrieve data after it has been deleted.\"[133]\n\n\nLens incidents\n\nIn September 2015, an 18-year-old was using a Snapchat feature called \"Lens\" to record the speed she was driving her Mercedes C230 when she crashed into a Mitsubishi Outlander in Hampton, Georgia. The 107\u0026#160;mph (172\u0026#160;km/h) crash injured both drivers. The driver of the Outlander spent five weeks in intensive care\nwhile he was treated for severe traumatic brain injury\n. In April 2016, the Outlander driver sued both Snapchat and the user of Snapchat, alleging that Snapchat knew its application was being used in unlawful speed contests, yet did nothing to prevent such use so is negligent.[134]\n\n\nA similar collision while driving at 115\u0026#160;mph (185\u0026#160;km/h), occurred in Tampa, Florida in October 2016 that killed five people.[135]\n\n\nPatent infringement\n\nIn 2016, Snapchat was sued by Canadian company Investel for infringement on its geofiltering patent.[136]\n\n[137]\n\n\n\n\"Poor Country\" remark\n\nAccording to former Snapchat employee Anthony Pompliano in a lawsuit filed against Snap Inc.,\u0026#160;Spiegel made a statement in 2015 that Snapchat is \"only for rich people\" and that he does not \"want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain\".[138]\n\nThe incident sparked a Twitter trend\ncalled \"#UninstallSnapchat\", in which Indian users uninstalled the app,[139]\n\nand caused backlash against the company in terms of low \"one-star\" ratings for the app in the Google Play\nstore and Apple\n's App Store\n.[140]\n\n[141]\n\nSnapchat's shares fell by 1.5%.[142]\n\nIn response to the allegation, Snapchat called Pompliano's claim \"ridiculous\", and elaborated that \"Obviously Snapchat is for everyone. It’s available worldwide to download for free\".[141]\n\n\n\n\"Snap Map\" privacy concerns\n\nThe June 2017 release of \"Snap Map\", a feature that broadcasts the user's location on a map, was met with concerns over privacy and safety. The feature, though opt-in, delivers a message asking if the user would like to show their position on the map, but reportedly doesn't explain the ramifications of doing so, including that the app updates the user's position on the map each time the app is opened and not just when actively capturing snaps, potentially allowing for stalkers. The map can be zoomed in to feature detailed geographical information, such as street addresses.[143]\n\nThe Daily Telegraph\n\nreported that police forces had issued child safety warnings,[144]\n\nwhile other media publications wrote that safety concerns were also raised for teenagers and adults unaware of the feature's actual behavior.[143]\n\n[145]\n\nIn a statement to The Verge\n\n, a Snapchat spokesperson said that \"The safety of our community is very important to us and we want to make sure that all Snapchatters, parents, and educators have accurate information about how the Snap Map works\".[143]\n\n\nSee also\n\nComparison of instant messaging clients\n\nEphemera\n– any transitory written or printed matter not meant to be retained or preserved\nList of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users\n\nTimeline of social media\n\nSobrr\n, another mobile application which deletes content after a specified time\n\nReferences\n\n^\n\n\n\"Snapchat - Android Apps on Google Play\"\n.

Live stories are estimated to reach an average of 20 million viewers in a 24-hour span.[73]\n\nIn September 2015, the service entered into a partnership with the National Football League\nto present live stories from selected games (including a Sunday game, and marquee games such as Monday Night Football\nand Thursday Night Football\n), with both parties contributing content and handling ad sales.[73]\n\n[110]\n\n","Mary Meeker, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield \u0026amp; Byers\n, which negotiated a financial agreement with Snapchat in August 2014,[111]\n\nhighlighted the growth of vertical video\nviewing in her 2015 Internet Trends Report – growing from 5% of video viewing in 2010 to 29% in 2015. Vertical video ads like Snapchat's are watched in their entirety nine times more than landscape video ads.[112]\n\n","In April 2016, NBC Olympics\nannounced that it had reached a deal with Snapchat to allow stories from the 2016 Summer Olympics\nto be featured on Snapchat in the United States. The content will include a behind-the-scenes Discover channel curated by BuzzFeed\n(a company which NBCUniversal\nhas funded), and stories featuring a combination of footage from NBC, athletes, and attendees. NBC will sell advertising and enter into revenue sharing agreements. This marks the first time NBC has allowed Olympics footage to be featured on third-party property.[113]\n\n","In July 2016, it was reported that Snapchat had submitted a patent\napplication for the process of using an object recognition system to deliver sponsored filters based on objects seen in a camera view.[114]\n\n","In April 2017, Digiday\n\nreported that Snapchat would launch a self-service manager for advertising on the platform.[115]\n\nThe feature launched the following month, alongside news of a Snapchat Mobile Dashboard for tracking ad campaigns, set to roll out in June to select countries.[116]\n\n","In April 2017, Snapchat introduced a \"Snap to Store\" advertising tool that lets companies using geostickers to track whether users buy their product or visit their store in a 7-day period after seeing the relevant geosticker.[117]\n\n[118]\n\n","Snapchat was hacked on December 31, 2013.[119]\n\n[120]\n\nGibson Security, an Australian security firm, had disclosed an API security vulnerability to the company on August 27, 2013,[121]\n\n[122]\n\nand then made public the source code for the exploit on Christmas Day (Australian time; Christmas Eve in the US).[123]\n\n[124]\n\nOn December 27, Snapchat announced that it had implemented mitigating features.[125]\n\nNonetheless, an anonymous group hacked them, saying that the mitigating features presented only \"minor obstacles\".[126]\n\n[127]\n\nThe hackers revealed parts of approximately 4.6\u0026#160;million Snapchat usernames and phone numbers on a website named \"SnapchatDB.info\"[120]\n\n[128]\n\n[129]\n\nand sent a statement to the popular technology blog TechCrunch\n\nsaying that their objective had been to \"raise public awareness\u0026#160;... and\u0026#160;... put public pressure on Snapchat\" to fix the vulnerability.[128]\n\nSnapchat apologized a week after the hack.[130]\n\n","In 2014, Snapchat settled a complaint made by the Federal Trade Commission\n. The government agency alleged that the company had exaggerated to the public the degree to which mobile app images and photos could actually be made to disappear. Under the terms of the agreement, Snapchat was not fined, but the app service agreed to have its claims and policies monitored by an independent party for a period of 20 years. The FTC concluded that Snapchat was prohibited from \"misrepresenting the extent to which it maintains the privacy, security, or confidentiality of users' information.\"[131]\n\n","Following the agreement, Snapchat updated its privacy page to state that the company \"can't guarantee that messages will be deleted within a specific timeframe.\" [132]\n\nEven after Snapchat deletes message data from their servers, that same data may remain in backup for a certain period of time.[132]\n\nIn a public blog post, the service warned that \"If you've ever tried to recover lost data after accidentally deleting a drive or maybe watched an episode of CSI\n\n, you might know that with the right forensic tools, it's sometimes possible to retrieve data after it has been deleted.\"[133]\n\n","In September 2015, an 18-year-old was using a Snapchat feature called \"Lens\" to record the speed she was driving her Mercedes C230 when she crashed into a Mitsubishi Outlander in Hampton, Georgia. The 107\u0026#160;mph (172\u0026#160;km/h) crash injured both drivers. The driver of the Outlander spent five weeks in intensive care\nwhile he was treated for severe traumatic brain injury\n. In April 2016, the Outlander driver sued both Snapchat and the user of Snapchat, alleging that Snapchat knew its application was being used in unlawful speed contests, yet did nothing to prevent such use so is negligent.[134]\n\n","A similar collision while driving at 115\u0026#160;mph (185\u0026#160;km/h), occurred in Tampa, Florida in October 2016 that killed five people.[135]\n\n","In 2016, Snapchat was sued by Canadian company Investel for infringement on its geofiltering patent.[136]\n\n[137]\n\n","According to former Snapchat employee Anthony Pompliano in a lawsuit filed against Snap Inc.,\u0026#160;Spiegel made a statement in 2015 that Snapchat is \"only for rich people\" and that he does not \"want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain\".[138]\n\nThe incident sparked a Twitter trend\ncalled \"#UninstallSnapchat\", in which Indian users uninstalled the app,[139]\n\nand caused backlash against the company in terms of low \"one-star\" ratings for the app in the Google Play\nstore and Apple\n's App Store\n.[140]\n\n[141]\n\nSnapchat's shares fell by 1.5%.[142]\n\nIn response to the allegation, Snapchat called Pompliano's claim \"ridiculous\", and elaborated that \"Obviously Snapchat is for everyone. It’s available worldwide to download for free\".[141]\n\n","The June 2017 release of \"Snap Map\", a feature that broadcasts the user's location on a map, was met with concerns over privacy and safety. The feature, though opt-in, delivers a message asking if the user would like to show their position on the map, but reportedly doesn't explain the ramifications of doing so, including that the app updates the user's position on the map each time the app is opened and not just when actively capturing snaps, potentially allowing for stalkers. The map can be zoomed in to feature detailed geographical information, such as street addresses.[143]\n\nThe Daily Telegraph\n\nreported that police forces had issued child safety warnings,[144]\n\nwhile other media publications wrote that safety concerns were also raised for teenagers and adults unaware of the feature's actual behavior.[143]\n\n[145]\n\nIn a statement to The Verge\n\n, a Snapchat spokesperson said that \"The safety of our community is very important to us and we want to make sure that all Snapchatters, parents, and educators have accurate information about how the Snap Map works\".[143]\n\n"],"title":"Snapchat","rels":["/wiki/Evan_Spiegel","/wiki/Bobby_Murphy_(businessman)","/wiki/Snap_Inc.#Controversy","/wiki/Photo_sharing","/wiki/Instant_messaging","/wiki/Videotelephony","/wiki/Multimedia","/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_clients","/wiki/Ephemera","/wiki/List_of_virtual_communities_with_more_than_100_million_active_users","/wiki/Timeline_of_social_media","/wiki/Sobrr","/wiki/Business_Insider","/wiki/Axel_Springer_SE","/wiki/Bitmoji","/wiki/Scan_(organisation)","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Timeline_of_Snapchat","/wiki/Dancing_Hot_Dog","/wiki/Spectacles_(product)","/wiki/Bobby_Murphy_(businessman)","/wiki/Evan_Spiegel","/wiki/Michael_Lynton","/wiki/Evan_Spiegel","/wiki/Bobby_Murphy_(businessman)","/wiki/Emily_White","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","/wiki/Snapchat","/wiki/Snapchat"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Snapchat#December_2013_hack"}

Initially believed to have affected over 1 billion user accounts,[2]\n\nYahoo! later affirmed in October 2017 that all 3 billion\n\nof its user accounts were impacted.[3]\n\nBoth breaches are considered the largest discovered in the history of the Internet\n. Specific details of material taken include names, email addresses, telephone numbers, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers, dates of birth, and hashed\npasswords\n.[4]\n\nFurther, Yahoo! reported that the late 2014 breach likely used manufactured web cookies\nto falsify login credentials, allowing hackers to gain access to any account without a password.[5]\n\n[6]\n\n[7]\n\n","Yahoo! has been criticized for their late disclosure of the breaches and their security measures, and is currently facing several lawsuits as well as investigation by members of the United States Congress. The breaches have impacted Verizon Communications\n's July 2016 plans to acquire Yahoo! for about $4.8 billion, which resulted in a decrease of $350 million in the final price on the deal closed in June 2017.","","","Around July 2016, account names and passwords for about 200 million Yahoo! accounts were presented for sale on the darknet market\nsite, \"TheRealDeal\n\".[8]\n\n[9]\n\nThe seller, known as \"Peace_of_Mind\" or simply \"Peace\", stated in confidential interviews with Vice\n\nand Wired\n\n, that he had had the data for some time and had been selling it privately since about late 2015. Peace has previously been connected to sales of similar private information data from other hacks including that from the 2012 LinkedIn hack\n.[10]\n\n[11]\n\nPeace stated the data likely dates back to 2012, and security experts believed it may have been parts of other data hacks at that time; while some of the sample accounts were still active, they lacked necessary information to fully login properly, reflecting their age.[10]\n\nExperts believe that Peace is only a broker of the information that hackers obtain and sell through him.[12]\n\nYahoo! stated they were aware of the data and were evaluating it, cautioning users about the situation but did not reset account passwords at that time.[10]\n\n","The first reported data breach in 2016 had taken place sometime in late 2014, according to Yahoo![13]\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\nThe hackers had obtained data from over 500 million user accounts, including account names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed\npasswords, and in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.Actor'_Hacked_500M_Accounts_16-0\" class=\"reference\"\u003ed_Actor'_Hacked_500M_Accounts-16\"\u003e[16]\n\n[17]\n\nSecurity experts noted that the majority of Yahoo!'s passwords used the bcrypt\nhashing algorithm, which is considered difficult to crack, the rest used the older MD5\nalgorithm which can be broken rather quickly.[18]\n\n","Such information, especially security questions and answers, could help hackers break into victims' other online accounts.[19]\n\n[20]\n\nComputer security\nexperts cautioned that the incident could have far-reaching consequences involving privacy, potentially including finance and banking as well as personal information of people's lives, including information pulled from any other accounts that can be hacked with the gained account data.[1]\n\nExperts also noted that there may be millions of people, as users of Flickr\n, Sky\nand BT\nwho do not realize that they have a Yahoo! account as a result of past acquisitions and agreements made with Yahoo!.[21]\n\nor Yahoo users who stopped using their accounts years earlier.[20]\n\n[22]\n\n[23]\n\n[24]\n\n","Yahoo! reported the breach to the public on September 22, 2016. Yahoo! believes the breach was committed by \"state-sponsored\n\" hackers,[25]\n\nbut did not name any country.[4]\n\nYahoo! affirmed the hacker was no longer in their systems and that the company was fully cooperating with law enforcement.[26]\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) confirmed that it was investigating the affair.[4]\n\n","In its November 2016 SEC\nfiling, Yahoo! reported they had been aware of an intrusion into their network in 2014, but had not understood the extent of the breach until it began investigation of a separate data breach incident around July 2016.[5]\n\n[27]\n\nWired\n\nbelieves this separate data breach involved the Peace data from July 2016.[15]\n\nYahoo!'s previous SEC filing on September 9, prior to the breach announcement, had stated that it was not aware of any \"security breaches\" or \"loss, theft, unauthorized access or acquisition\" of user data.[28]\n\n","The November 2016 SEC filing noted that the company believed the data breach had been conducted through a cookie\n-based attack that allowed hackers to authenticate as any other user without their password.[5]\n\n[6]\n\n[29]\n\nYahoo! and its outside security analysts confirmed this was the method of intrusion in their December 2016 announcement of the August 2013 data breach, and had invalidated all previous cookies to eliminate this route.[2]\n\n[7]\n\n[30]\n\nIn a regulatory filing in 2017, Yahoo! reported that 32 million accounts were accessed through this cookie-based attack through 2015 and 2016.[31]\n\nMultiple experts believe that the security breach was the largest such incident made public in the history of the Internet\nat the time.[4]\n\n[32]\n\n","Another data breach occurred on Yahoo! servers in August 2013; Yahoo! stated this was a separate breach from the late 2014 one and was conducted by an \"unauthorized third party\".[2]\n\nSimilar data as from the late 2014 breach had been taken from over 1 billion user accounts, including unencrypted security questions and answers. Yahoo! reported the breach on December 14, 2016, and forced all affected users to change passwords, and to reenter any unencrypted security questions and answers to make them encrypted in the future.[2]\n\nIn February 2017, Yahoo! notified some users that data from the breach and forged cookies\ncould have been used to access these accounts.[33]\n\nThis breach is now considered the largest known breach of its kind on the Internet.[2]\n\n[34]\n\nIn October 2017, Yahoo! updated its assessment of the hack, and stated that it believes all of its 3 billion accounts at the time of the August 2013 breach were affected.[3]\n\n[35]\n\n","Yahoo! stated that this new breach was discovered while it was reviewing data given to them from law enforcement from an unnamed third-party hacker about a month prior.[36]\n\nThey had been able to identify the method by which data were taken from the last 2014 hack using fake cookies during this investigation, but the method of the August 2013 breach was not clear to them upon their announcement.[2]\n\nAndrew Komarov, chief intelligence officer of the cybersecurity firm InfoArmor, had been helping Yahoo! and law enforcement already in response to the Peace data. In trying to track down the source of Peace's data, he discovered evidence of this latest breach from a dark web\nseller offering a list of more than one billion Yahoo! accounts for about $300,000 in August 2015. While two of the three buyers of this data were found to be underground spammers\n, the third buyer had specifically asked the seller of the Yahoo! data to affirm if ten names of United States and foreign government officials were on the offered list and information associated with them. Suspecting that this buyer may have been related to a foreign intelligence agency, Komarov discovered that the offered data included the accounts of over 150,000 names of people working for the United States government and military, as well as additional accounts associated with European Union, Canadian, British, and Australian governments.[36]\n\n[37]\n\nKomarov alerted the appropriate agencies about this new data set and began working with them directly.[36]\n\nKomarov noted that while U.S. government policies have changed to keep key intelligence employees as low-key as possible, these affected users likely set up Yahoo! accounts for personal use well before such policies were in place, and included their work details as part of their profiles, making this information highly valuable for foreign intelligence groups.[37]\n\nKomarov had opted not to go to Yahoo! about the data, as they had previously been dismissive of InfoArmor's services in the past, and Komarov believed that Yahoo! would not thoroughly investigate the situation as it would threaten their Verizon buyout.[36]\n\n","In addition to government issues, Komarov and other security firms warned that the data from this breach can be used to attempt access to other accounts, since it included backup email contact addresses and security questions. Such data, these experts warn, could be used to create phishing\nattacks to lure users into revealing sensitive information which can then be used for malicious purposes. Hold Security, another cybersecurity firm, observed that some darkweb sellers were still selling this database for up to $200,000 as late as October 2016; Komarov found that the data continues to be available at a much lower price since the passwords have been forced changed, but the data can still be valuable for phishing attacks and gaining access to other accounts.[36]\n\n","According to Yahoo, the 2014 breach was carried out by a \"state-sponsored actor\"[26]\n\nand the organization claims that such \"intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry\".[19]\n\nWhile Yahoo! did not name any country, some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.[4]\n\n[38]\n\n[39]\n\n","U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the Russian government\n.[4]\n\nYahoo! in fall 2014 detected what it believed was a small breach \"involving 30 to 40 accounts\", carried out by hackers believed to be \"working on behalf of the Russian government\", according to Yahoo! executives, because it was launched from computers in that country. Yahoo! reported the incident to the FBI in late 2014 and notified affected users.[40]\n\n","Sean Sullivan, a security adviser at cyber security firm F-Secure\nLabs, declared China to be his top suspect and said that \"there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo! being targeted [by Russia],\" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, or to undermine politicians, while \"China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information\" and \"has a voracious appetite for personal information\".[41]\n\nExamples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion include the massive data breach\n[42]\n\nof 18 million people from the United States Office of Personnel Management\nand the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed Operation Aurora\n.[41]\n\n","Others expressed doubt about Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo! to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a cybercriminal\ngroup or individual—particularly as Yahoo! is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.[38]\n\nSenior research scientist Kenneth Geers from Comodo\n, however, noted that \"Yahoo! is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection\".[38]\n\nOne of the effects, if not the direct goal, of the breaches was the use of the stolen usernames and passwords for credential stuffing\nattacks.[43]\n\n","InfoArmor issued a report that challenged Yahoo's claim that a nation-state orchestrated the heist after reviewing a small sample of compromised accounts.[44]\n\nInfoArmor had been able to obtain the list of affected accounts for analysis. InfoArmor determined that the breach was likely the work of an Eastern European criminal gang that later sold the entire hacked database to at least three clients, including one state-sponsored group. According to InfoArmor, by early 2015, the group no longer offered to sell the full database, but sought \"to extract something from the dump for significant amounts of money.\" The report noted that it was difficult to determine who the ultimate mastermind of a hack might be, as criminal hackers\nsometimes provide information to government intelligence agencies or offer their services for hire. Komarov said the hackers may be related to Group E\n, who have had a track record of selling stolen personal data on the dark web\n, primarily to underground spammers\n, and were previously linked to breaches at LinkedIn, Tumblr, and MySpace.[45]\n\nInfoArmor had linked Group E as the source of the data that were offered by Peace, and believed that Group E was brokering the data to dark web sellers.[12]\n\nWhile InfoArmor did not believe a state-sponsored agency committed the breach, they warned of implications on foreign intelligences, as the breaches \"opens the door to significant opportunities for cyber-espionage and targeted attacks,\" and may be the key in several targeted attacks against U.S. government personnel, which resulted after the disclosed contacts of the affected high-level officials of intelligence community in October 2015.[44]\n\n[46]\n\n","Yahoo! stated that the 2013 breach is connected \"to the same state-sponsored actor believed to be responsible for the data theft the company disclosed on September 22, 2016.\"[34]\n\nWhite House\nspokespersons stated that the FBI is currently investigating this breach, though the scope of its impact is unclear.[47]\n\nA United States official, speaking to CBS News\n, says that government investigators agree with Yahoo! that the hack was sponsored by a foreign state, possibly Russia\n.[48]\n\nSecurity experts speculate that because little of the data from this 2013 breach have been made available on the black market, the breach was likely targeted to find information on specific people.[48]\n\n","On March 15, 2017, the FBI officially charged the 2014 breach to four men, including two that work for Russia's Federal Security Service\n(FSB). In its statement, the FBI said \"The criminal conduct at issue, carried out and otherwise facilitated by officers from an FSB unit that serves as the FBI’s point of contact in Moscow on cybercrime matters, is beyond the pale.\"[49]\n\nThe four men accused include Alexsey Belan\n, a hacker\non the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives\nlist, FSB agents Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin who the FBI accused of paying Belan and other hackers to conduct the hack, and Canadian hacker Karim Baratov who the FBI claimed was paid by Dokuchaev and Sushchin to use data obtained by the Yahoo! breaches to breach into about 80 non-Yahoo! accounts of specific targets.[50]\n\nBaratov, the only man currently arrested, was extradited to the United States, though had claimed not guilty to the charges in August 2017. His plea hearing was to start on November 28, 2017 in San Francisco.[50]\n\n","Yahoo!'s delay in discovering and reporting these breaches, as well as implementing improved security features, has become a point of criticism.[51]\n\nYahoo! has been taken to task for having a seemingly lax attitude towards security: the company reportedly does not implement new security features as fast as other Internet companies, and after Yahoo! was identified by Edward Snowden\nas a frequent target for state-sponsored hackers in 2013, it took the company a full year before hiring a dedicated chief information security officer, Alex Stamos. While Stamos' hiring was praised by technology experts as showing Yahoo!'s commitment towards better security, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer\nhad reportedly denied Stamos and his security team sufficient funds to implement recommended stronger security measures, and he departed the company by 2015. Experts have pointed out that Yahoo!, only until the most recent breaches, had not forced affected users to change their passwords, a move that Mayer and her team believed would drive users away from the service.[52]\n\nSome experts stated that implementing stronger security measures does take monetary resources, and Yahoo!'s financial situation has not allowed the company to invest in cybersecurity.[51]\n\n","Yahoo!'s internal review of the situation found that Mayer and other key executives knew of the intrusions but failed to inform the company or take steps to prevent further breaches. The review led to the resignation of the company's principle lawyer, Ronald S. Bell by March 2017, and Mayer's equity compensation bonus for 2016 and 2017 were pulled.[53]\n\n","In July 2016, prior to the announcement of the breaches Verizon Communications\nhad entered into negotiations and approval to purchase Yahoo! for $4.8 billion, with the deal set to close in March 2017.[32]\n\nVerizon had only become aware of the 2014 breach just two days prior to the Yahoo! September announcement.[4]\n\nCEO Lowell McAdam\nsaid he wasn't shocked by the hack, saying \"we all live in an internet world, it's not a question of if you're going to get hacked but when you are going to get hacked\". He left the door open to possibly renegotiate the $4.83 billion price tag.[54]\n\nCraig Silliman, Verizon's general counsel told reporters in Washington Verizon has \"a reasonable basis to believe right now that the impact is material\" and that they're \"looking to Yahoo to demonstrate [...] the full impact\". The company's reputation has suffered online in the last few months, according to an analysis\nby marketing firm Spredfast: about 90 percent of the Twitter comments about Yahoo! were negative in October, up from 68 percent in August, before news of the hack.[55]\n\nFollowing the announcement of the August 2013 breach, Verizon was reportedly seeking to change terms of the deal to reflect on the impact of these breaches, including lowering their offer or potentially seeking court action as to terminate the deal. Verizon stated that they will \"review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions\".[56]\n\nIn February 2017, Verizon and Yahoo! announced that the deal will still go forward, but dropping the sale price by $350 million, down to $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed at this reduced price in June 2017, with Mayer stepping down as CEO following the closure.[57]\n\nVerizon and Yahoo! will share jointly in the ongoing costs for the government investigation of the breaches under this new term.[58]\n\n","Members of the U.S. Government have been critical of Yahoo!'s reactions to these breaches. In a letter to Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer\n, six Democratic U.S. Senators (Elizabeth Warren\n, Patrick Leahy\n, Al Franken\n, Richard Blumenthal\n, Ron Wyden\nand Ed Markey\n) demanded answers on when Yahoo! discovered the last 2014 breach, and why it took so long to disclose it to the public, calling the time lag between the security breach and its disclosure 'unacceptable'.[59]\n\n[60]\n\n[61]\n\nOn September 26, 2016 democratic senator Mark Warner\nasked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) to investigate whether Yahoo! and its senior executives fulfilled their obligations under federal securities laws to properly disclose the attack. In his letter,[62]\n\nWarner also asked the SEC to evaluate whether the current disclosure regime was adequate. Jacob Olcott, who helped develop the SEC data breach disclosure rules\nand former Senate Commerce Committee counsel, noted that due to the size of the breach, intense public scrutiny and uncertainty over the timing of Yahoo's discovery, the hack could become a test case of the SEC's guidelines.[63]\n\n[64]\n\nFollowing the announcement of the August 2013 breach, Sen. Warner called for a full investigation of the situation, asking \"why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users\".[56]\n\n","By November 9, 2016, it was reported that 23 lawsuits related to the late 2014 breach had been filed against Yahoo! so far.[27]\n\nIn one lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California\nin San Diego\n, the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an \"intrusion into personal financial matters.\" In another lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nin San Jose\n, the plaintiff contends that Yahoo! acted with gross negligence\nin dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo! declined to comment on ongoing litigation.[32]\n\nFive of these 23 cases were combined into a single suit in early December 2016 to be heard in San Jose in March 2017.[65]\n\nThe presiding judge authorized the class-action lawsuit to go forward in August 2017, citing that those affected by the breached had the right to sue Yahoo! for breach of contract and unfair competition claims made in the original filing.[66]\n\nFollowing the December 14 announcement of the August 2013 hacks, another class-action lawsuit was filed against Yahoo! in New York state on behalf of all affected United States residents, stating that \"Yahoo! failed, and continues to fail, to provide adequate protection of its users’ personal and confidential information.\"[67]\n\n","Foreign governments have also expressed concern on these breaches. On October 28, the European privacy regulators \"Article 29 Working Party\" outlined concerns about the 2014 data breach as well as allegations that the company built a system that scanned customers' incoming emails\nat the request of U.S. intelligence services in a letter[68]\n\nto Yahoo.[69]\n\nThey asked Yahoo! to communicate all aspects of the data breach to the EU authorities, to notify the affected users of the \"adverse effects\" and to cooperate with all \"upcoming national data protection authorities' enquiries and/or investigations\".[70]\n\nIn late November, Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner\n(DPC), the lead European regulator on privacy issues for Yahoo! whose European headquarters are in Dublin, said that it had stepped up its examination of the breach, that it was awaiting information from Yahoo! on allegations that it helped the U.S. government scan users' emails, and that Yahoo! was not investigating the breach but just examining it.[71]\n\nGermany's Federal Office for Information Security\ncriticized Yahoo! following the December 2016 announcement, stating \"security is not a foreign concept\", and warned government and other German users to seek email and Internet solutions from companies with better security approaches.[72]\n\n"],"title":"Yahoo!

[2]\n\nAccording to Anthem, Inc., the data breach extended into multiple brands Anthem, Inc. uses\nto market its healthcare plans, including, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Amerigroup\n, Caremore\n, and UniCare\n.[3]\n\nHealthlink\nsays it was also a victim.[4]\n\nAnthem says the medical information and financial data was not compromised. Anthem has offered free credit monitoring in the wake of the breach.[5]\n\nAccording to Bloomberg News\n, China\nmay be responsible for this data breach. Michael Daniel, chief adviser on cybersecurity\nfor President Barack Obama\n, said he would be changing his own password.[6]\n\nAccording to The New York Times\n\nabout 80 million company records were hacked, and there is fear that the stolen data will be used for identity theft\n. [7]\n\nThe compromised information contained names, birthdays, medical IDs, social security numbers\n, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information, including income data.[8]\n\n[9]\n\n","","","The data was stolen over a period of weeks the month before the data breach was discovered.[10]\n\n","Anthem was not required by law to encrypt the data.[11]\n\nHowever, Anthem faced several civil class-action lawsuits, which were settled in 2017 at a cost of $115 million.

The images were initially believed to have been obtained via a breach of Apple\n's cloud services\nsuite iCloud\n,[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\nbut it later turned out that the hackers could have taken advantage of a security issue in the iCloud API\nwhich allowed them to make unlimited attempts at guessing victims' passwords.[4]\n\n[5]\n\nHowever access was later revealed to have been gained via targeted phishing\nattacks.[6]\n\n[7]\n\n","The event, which media outlets and Internet users referred to under names such as \"The Fappening\n\" (a portmanteau\nof the words \"fap\"—a slang term for masturbation\n—and the film The Happening\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n\n) and \"Celebgate\n\", was met with a varied reaction from the media and fellow celebrities. Critics felt that the distribution of the images was a major invasion of privacy for their subjects, while some of the allegedly depicted subjects questioned their authenticity. The leak also prompted increased concern from analysts surrounding the privacy and security of cloud computing\nservices such as iCloud—with a particular emphasis on their use to store sensitive, private information.","","","The images were obtained via the online storage\noffered by Apple\n's iCloud\nplatform for automatically backing up photos from iOS\ndevices, such as iPhones\n.[10]\n\nApple later reported that the victims' iCloud account information was obtained using \"a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions\", such as phishing\nand brute-force\nguessing.[6]\n\n[7]\n\n[11]\n\nIt was initially believed that the images were obtained using an exploit in the Find My iPhone\nservice.[10]\n\nCourt documents from 2014 indicated that one user created a fake email account called \"appleprivacysecurity\" to ask celebrities for security information.[12]\n\nThe photos were being passed around privately for at least a couple of weeks before their public release on August 31.

Notifications will be provided whenever data is restored to a device via iCloud and after logging into iCloud via a web browser,[65]\n\nin addition to existing notifications when a user's iCloud password is changed. Additionally, Apple will broaden and encourage the use of two-factor authentication\nin future versions of its software and operating systems, such as the then-upcoming IOS 8\n. In conclusion, he emphasized that \"we want to do everything we can do to protect our customers, because we are as outraged if not more so than they are.\"[11]\n\n","Jennifer Lawrence contacted authorities and her publicist has stated that the authorities will prosecute anyone who posts leaked images of her.[66]\n\nForbes\ncolumnist Joseph Steinberg\nquestioned whether the reactions by law enforcement and technology providers indicated that celebrities were being treated differently from ordinary Americans, which, in the case of law enforcement, may be illegal.[67]\n\n","On October 1, 2014, Google\nwas threatened with a lawsuit by lawyer Martin Singer for $100 million on behalf of unnamed victims of the leaks, alleging that Google had refused to respond to requests for the images to be removed from its platforms (including Blogger\nand YouTube\n), \"[failing] to act expeditiously, and responsibly to remove the images\", and \"knowingly accommodating, facilitating, and perpetuating the unlawful conduct\".[68]\n\n[69]\n\n","In an interview with Vanity Fair\n\n, Lawrence called the leak a \"sex crime\" and a \"sexual violation\" and added, \"anybody who looked at those pictures, you're perpetuating a sexual offense and you should cower with shame\".[70]\n\nThis view was contrasted by another victim of the hack, Emily Ratajkowski\n, who told GQ\n, \"A lot of people who were victims of [the hack] said anyone who looks at these pictures should feel guilty, but I just don't think that's fair\", and \"I'm not sure that anyone who Googles it is necessarily a criminal. I think the people who stole the photos are\".[71]\n\n","The FBI\nsaid that it was \"aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals, and is addressing the matter.\"[72]\n\nSimilarly, Apple stated that it had been investigating whether a security breach of the iCloud service was responsible for the leaked photographs, as per the company's commitment to user privacy.[59]\n\n[73]\n\nOn September 2, 2014, Apple reported that the leaked images were the result of compromised accounts, using \"a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet\".[6]\n\n[7]\n\n","In October 2014, FBI searched a house in Chicago\nand seized several computers, cell phones and storage drives after tracking the source of a hacking attack to an IP address linked to an individual named Emilio Herrera. A related search warrant application mentioned eight victims with initials A.S., C.H., H.S., J.M., O.W., A.K., E.B., and A.H., what supposedly points to stolen photos of Abigail Spencer\n, Christina Hendricks\n, Hope Solo\n, Jennette McCurdy\n, Olivia Wilde\n, Anna Kendrick\n, Emily Browning\n, and Amber Heard\n. According to law enforcement officials, Herrera is just one of several people under investigation and the FBI has carried out various searches across the country.[74]\n\n[75]\n\n[76]\n\n","In March 2016, 36-year-old Ryan Collins of Lancaster\n, Pennsylvania\nagreed to plead guilty to one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information resulting in a 18-month sentence.[77]\n\nWhile no victims were named in the court documents, numerous media outlets connected Collins' case to The Fappening. During the investigation, it was found that Collins phished by sending e-mails to the victims that looked like they came from Apple or Google, warning the victims that their accounts might be compromised and asking for their account details. The victims would enter their passwords, and Collins gained access to their accounts, downloading e-mails and iCloud backups.[78]\n\nIn October 2016, Collins was sentenced to 18 months in prison.[79]\n\n[80]\n\nIn August 2016, 28-year-old Edward Majerczyk of Chicago\n, Illinois\nagreed to plead guilty to a similar phishing scheme, although authorities believe he worked independently of Collins and he was not accused of selling the images or posting them online.[81]\n\n[82]\n\nOn January 24, 2017, Majerczyk was sentenced to nine months in prison and was ordered to pay $5,700 in restitution to cover the counseling services of one unnamed celebrity victim.[82]\n\n"],"title":"iCloud leaks of celebrity photos","rels":["/wiki/Criticism_of_Apple_Inc.","/wiki/Edison_Chen_photo_scandal","/wiki/Sexting","/wiki/Variety_(magazine)","/wiki/February_2010_Australian_cyberattacks","/wiki/Operation_Aurora","/wiki/Operation_Payback","/wiki/DigiNotar","/wiki/HBGary","/wiki/Operation_AntiSec","/wiki/Operation_Tunisia","/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage","/wiki/RSA_SecurID#March_2011_system_compromise","/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack","/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak","/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack","/wiki/Snapchat#December_2013_hack","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#August_2013_breach","/wiki/Anthem_medical_data_breach","/wiki/Operation_Tovar","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack","/wiki/2014_Russian_hacker_password_theft","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach","/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach","/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach","/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach","/wiki/VTech#2015_data_breach","/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack","/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery","/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center#Ransomware","/wiki/Commission_on_Elections_data_breach","/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack","/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/2017_Westminster_cyberattack","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/2017_cyberattacks_on_Ukraine","/wiki/Equifax#May–July_2017_data_breach","/wiki/Deloitte#2016–17_email_hack","/wiki/Disqus#October_2017_security_breach","/wiki/Anonymous_(group)","/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous","/wiki/Bureau_121","/wiki/Cozy_Bear","/wiki/CyberBerkut","/wiki/Derp_(hacker_group)","/wiki/Equation_Group","/wiki/Fancy_Bear","/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America","/wiki/Goatse_Security","/wiki/Guccifer_2.0","/wiki/Hacking_Team","/wiki/Iranian_Cyber_Army","/wiki/Lizard_Squad","/wiki/LulzRaft","/wiki/LulzSec","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack#Perpetrators","/wiki/NullCrew","/wiki/NSO_Group","/wiki/PayPal_14","/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398","/wiki/PLATINUM_(cybercrime_group)","/wiki/Pranknet","/wiki/RedHack","/wiki/Rocket_Kitten","/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers","/wiki/Syrian_Electronic_Army","/wiki/TeaMp0isoN","/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations","/wiki/UGNazi","/wiki/Yemen_Cyber_Army","/wiki/George_Hotz","/wiki/Guccifer","/wiki/Hector_Monsegur","/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond","/wiki/Junaid_Hussain","/wiki/Kristoffer_von_Hassel","/wiki/Mustafa_Al-Bassam","/wiki/MLT_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Ryan_Ackroyd","/wiki/Topiary_(hacktivist)","/wiki/The_Jester_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Weev","/wiki/Evercookie","/wiki/ISeeYou","/wiki/Heartbleed","/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)","/wiki/POODLE","/wiki/Rootpipe","/wiki/Row_hammer","/wiki/JASBUG","/wiki/Stagefright_(bug)","/wiki/DROWN_attack","/wiki/Badlock","/wiki/Dirty_COW","/wiki/Cloudbleed","/wiki/Broadcom#Vulnerabilities","/wiki/EternalBlue","/wiki/DoublePulsar","/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology#Silent_Bob_is_Silent","/wiki/KRACK","/wiki/ROCA_vulnerability","/wiki/BlueBorne_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Ransomware#Bad_Rabbit","/wiki/Careto_(malware)","/wiki/CryptoLocker","/wiki/Dexter_(malware)","/wiki/Duqu","/wiki/Duqu_2.0","/wiki/FinFisher","/wiki/Flame_(malware)","/wiki/Gameover_ZeuS","/wiki/Mahdi_(malware)","/wiki/Metulji_botnet","/wiki/Mirai_(malware)","/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog","/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club#Staatstrojaner_affair","/wiki/Shamoon","/wiki/Stars_virus","/wiki/Stuxnet","/wiki/Vault_7","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/X-Agent","/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos","/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos"}

The components clearly suggest an intent to gain repeated entry, extract information, and be destructive, as well as remove evidence of the attack.[10]\n\n[11]\n\n","Sony was made aware of the hack on Monday, November 24, 2014, as the malware previously installed rendered many Sony employees' computers inoperable by the software, with the warning by a group calling themselves the Guardians of Peace, along with a portion of the confidential data taken during the hack.[12]\n\nSeveral Sony-related Twitter accounts were also taken over.[8]\n\nThis followed a message that several Sony Pictures executives had received via email on the previous Friday, November 21; the message, coming from a group called \"God'sApstls\"  [sic\n\n], demanded \"monetary compensation\" or otherwise, \"Sony Pictures will be bombarded as a whole\".[12]\n\nThis email message had been mostly ignored by executives, lost in the volume they had received or treated as spam email.[12]\n\nIn addition to the activation of the malware on November 24, the message included a warning for Sony to decide on their course of action by 11pm that evening, although no apparent threat was made when that deadline passed.[12]\n\nIn the days following this hack, the Guardians of Peace began leaking yet-unreleased films and started to release portions of the confidential data to attract the attention of social media sites, although they did not specify what they wanted in return.[12]\n\nSony quickly organized internal teams to try to manage the loss of data to the Internet, and contacted the FBI and the private security firm FireEye\nto help protect Sony employees whose personal data was exposed by the hack, repair the damaged computer infrastructure and trace the source of the leak.[12]\n\nThe first public report concerning a North Korean link to the attack was published by Re/code\n\non November 28 and later confirmed by NBC News\n[13]\n\n","On December 8, 2014, alongside the eighth large data dump of confidential information, the GOP threatened Sony with language relating to the September 11 attacks\nthat drew the attention of U.S. security agencies.[12]\n\n[14]\n\nNorth Korean\nstate-sponsored hackers are suspected by the United States of being involved in part due to specific threats made toward Sony and movie theaters showing The Interview\n\n, a comedy film about an assassination attempt against Kim Jong-un\n.[15]\n\nNorth Korean officials had previously expressed concerns about the film to the United Nations\n, stating that \"to allow the production and distribution of such a film on the assassination of an incumbent head of a sovereign state should be regarded as the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war.\"[16]\n\n","In its first quarter financials for 2015, Sony Pictures set aside $15 million to deal with ongoing damages from the hack.[17]\n\nSony has bolstered its cyber-security infrastructure as a result, using solutions to prevent similar hacks or data loss in the future.[12]\n\nSony co-chairperson Amy Pascal\nannounced in the wake of the hack that she would step down as of May 2015, and instead will become more involved with film production under Sony.[18]\n\n","According to a notice letter dated December 8, 2014, from SPE to its employees, SPE learned on December 1, 2014, that personally identifiable information about employees and their dependents may have been obtained by unauthorized individuals as a result of a \"brazen cyber-attack\", including names, addresses, social security numbers and financial information.[19]\n\nOn December 7, 2014, C-SPAN\nreported that the hackers stole 47,000 unique Social Security numbers from the SPE computer network.[20]\n\n","Although personal data may have been stolen, early news reports focused mainly on celebrity gossip and embarrassing details about Hollywood and film industry business affairs gleaned by the media from electronic files, including private e-mail messages.

It was also an attack on our freedom of expression\nand way of life.\" He encouraged businesses and other organizations to use the Cybersecurity Framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) to assess and limit cyber risks and protect against cyber threats.[84]\n\nOn the same day, U.S. Secretary of State\nJohn Kerry\npublished his remarks condemning North Korea for the cyber-attack and threats against movie theatres and moviegoers. \"This provocative and unprecedented attack and subsequent threats only strengthen our resolve to continue to work with partners around the world to strengthen cybersecurity, promote norms of acceptable state behavior\n, uphold freedom of expression, and ensure that the Internet remains open\n, interoperable\n, secure and reliable\n,\" he said.[85]\n\n","On January 2, 2015, the U.S. installed additional economic sanctions on already-sanctioned North Korea for the hack,[86]\n\nwhich North Korean officials called out as \"groundlessly stirring up bad blood towards\" the country.[87]\n\n","Members of the press and cybersecurity experts have expressed doubt about the claims that North Korea was behind the hack. Cyber security experts, independently analyzing the hack separately from the FBI—including Kurt Stammberger from cyber security firm Norse,[88]\n\n[89]\n\nDEFCON organizer and Cloudflare\nresearcher Marc Rogers,[90]\n\nHector Monsegur\n,[91]\n\nand Kim Zetter\n, a security journalist at Wired\nmagazine\n[92]\n\n—have tended to agree that North Korea might not be behind the attack.","Michael Hiltzik\n, a Los Angeles Times\n\njournalist, said that all evidence against North Korea was \"circumstantial\" and that some cybersecurity experts were \"skeptical\" about attributing the attack to the North Koreans.[93]\n\nCybersecurity expert Lucas Zaichkowsky said, \"State-sponsored attackers don't create cool names for themselves like 'Guardians of Peace' and promote their activity to the public.\"[94]\n\nKim Zetter of Wired\nmagazine called released evidence against the government \"flimsy\".[95]\n\nFormer hacker Hector Monsegur\n, who once hacked into Sony, explained to CBS News\nthat exfiltrating one or one hundred terabytes\nof data \"without anyone noticing\" would have taken months or years, not weeks. Monsegur doubted the accusations due to North Korea's insufficient internet infrastructure to handle the transfer of that much data. He believed that it could have been either Chinese, Russian, or North Korean-sponsored hackers working outside of the country, but most likely to be the deed of a Sony employee.[96]\n\n","Stammberger provided to the FBI Norse's findings that suggest the hack was an inside job\n, stating, \"Sony was not just hacked; this is a company that was essentially nuked from the inside. We are very confident that this was not an attack master-minded by North Korea and that insiders were key to the implementation of one of the most devastating attacks in history.\"[97]\n\nStammberger believes that the security failure may have originated from six disgruntled former Sony employees, based on their past skill sets and discussions these people made in chat rooms. Norse employees identified these people from a list of workers that were eliminated from Sony during a restructuring in May 2014, and noted that some had made very public and angry responses to their firing, and would be in appropriate positions to identify the means to access secure parts of Sony's servers.[98]\n\n[99]\n\nAfter a private briefing lasting three hours, the FBI formally rejected Norse's alternative assessment.[100]\n\n","In response to allegations that the intrusion was the result of an inside job, or something other than a state-sponsored cyber attack, computer forensic specialist Kevin Mandia, president of the security firm FireEye\n, commented that there isn't a \"shred of evidence\" that an insider was responsible for the attack and that the evidence uncovered by his security firm supports the position of the United States government.[101]\n\n[102]\n\n","In February 2016, analytics firm Novetta issued a joint investigative report into the attack. The report, published in collaboration with Kaspersky Lab\n, Symantec\n, AlienVault\n, Invincea\n, Trend Micro\n, Carbon Black\n, PunchCyber, RiskIQ\n, ThreatConnect\nand Volexity, concluded that a well-resourced organization had committed the intrusion, and that \"we strongly believe that the SPE attack was not the work of insiders or hacktivists\". The analysis said that the same group is engaged in military espionage campaigns.[103]\n\n[104]\n\n[105]\n\n","Because of the depth and scope of malware tools, structure of the analyzed code bases, TTP overlap with similar attacks, and long trail of activities attributed to the Lazarus Group\n, Novetta does not believe that the SPE attack was carried out by insiders or hacktivists, but rather by a more structured, resourced, and motivated organization. ... Although our analysis cannot support direct attribution of a nation-state or other specific group due to the difficulty of proper attribution in the cyber realm, the FBI's official attribution claims could be supported by our findings.[106]\n\n","On January 2, 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order enacting additional sanctions against the North Korean government and a North Korean arms dealer, specifically citing the cyber attack and ongoing North Korean policies.[107]\n\n","Obama also issued a legislative proposal to Congress to update current laws such as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\nand introduce new ones to allow federal and national law enforcement officials to better respond to cybercrimes like the Sony hack, and to be able to prosecute such crimes compatibly to similar off-line crimes, while protecting the privacy of Americans.[108]\n\n[109]\n\n","In December 2014, Sony requested that the media stop covering the hack.[4]\n\nSony also threatened legal action if the media did not comply, but according to law professor Eugene Volokh\n, Sony's legal threats are \"unlikely to prevail\".[110]\n\nSony then threatened legal action against Twitter\nif it did not suspend accounts of people who posted the hacked material.[111]\n\nAmerican screenwriter Aaron Sorkin\nwrote an op-ed\nfor The New York Times\n\nopining that the media was helping the hackers by publishing and reporting on the leaked information.[112]\n\nOn December 18, Reddit\ntook the unusual step of banning a subpage called \"SonyGOP\" that was being used to distribute the hacked files.[113]\n\n","The threats made directly at Sony over The Interview\nwas seen by many as a threat on free speech. The decision to pull the film was criticized by several Hollywood filmmakers, actors, and television hosts, including Ben Stiller\n, Steve Carell\n, Rob Lowe\n, Jimmy Kimmel\nand Judd Apatow\n.[114]\n\n[115]\n\nSome commentators contrasted the situation to the non-controversial release of the 2004 Team America: World Police\n\n, a film that mocked the leadership of North Korea's prior leader, Kim Jong-il\n.[116]\n\nThe Alamo Drafthouse\nwas poised to replace showings of The Interview\nwith Team America\nuntil the film's distributor Paramount Pictures\nordered the theaters to stop.[117]\n\n","In light of the threats made to Sony over The Interview\n, New Regency\ncancelled its March 2015 production plans for a film adaptation of the graphic novel Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea\n\n, which was set to star Steve Carell\n.[118]\n\nHustler\n\nannounced its intentions to make a pornographic parody film\nof The Interview\n. Hustler\nfounder Larry Flynt\nsaid, \"If Kim Jong-un and his henchmen were upset before, wait till they see the movie we're going to make\".[119]\n\n","In China, the media coverage of the hackings has been limited, including in search engines except Google\n, which has given out 36 million results. Hua Chunying\n, a spokeswoman of foreign affairs, \"shied away from directly addressing\" the Sony hacking situation.[120]\n\nOn December 25, 2014, Russia offered sympathy to North Korea, saying it was \"quite understandable\" that North Korea would be upset over the film. Russia said American threats of retaliation were \"counterproductive and dangerous\", and that the US did not provide any proof of who hacked Sony.[121]\n\n","A documentary about the Sony hacks is being developed by director Jehane Noujaim\nand producers Kareem Amer and Mike Lerner. Prior to November 2014, the group were already working on a documentary about international cyberattacks, and quickly switched focus after the revelation of the Sony hacks.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df450262df3aa1b2f580"},"content":{"contents":["The Internet service company Yahoo!\nreported two major data breaches\nof user account data to hackers\nduring the second half of 2016. The first announced breach, reported in September 2016, had occurred sometime in late 2014, and affected over 500 million Yahoo! user accounts.[1]\n\nA separate data breach, occurring earlier around August 2013, was reported in December 2016. Initially believed to have affected over 1 billion user accounts,[2]\n\nYahoo! later affirmed in October 2017 that all 3 billion\n\nof its user accounts were impacted.[3]\n\nBoth breaches are considered the largest discovered in the history of the Internet\n. Specific details of material taken include names, email addresses, telephone numbers, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers, dates of birth, and hashed\npasswords\n.[4]\n\nFurther, Yahoo! reported that the late 2014 breach likely used manufactured web cookies\nto falsify login credentials, allowing hackers to gain access to any account without a password.[5]\n\n[6]\n\n[7]\n\n","Yahoo! has been criticized for their late disclosure of the breaches and their security measures, and is currently facing several lawsuits as well as investigation by members of the United States Congress. The breaches have impacted Verizon Communications\n's July 2016 plans to acquire Yahoo! for about $4.8 billion, which resulted in a decrease of $350 million in the final price on the deal closed in June 2017.","","","Around July 2016, account names and passwords for about 200 million Yahoo! accounts were presented for sale on the darknet market\nsite, \"TheRealDeal\n\".[8]\n\n[9]\n\nThe seller, known as \"Peace_of_Mind\" or simply \"Peace\", stated in confidential interviews with Vice\n\nand Wired\n\n, that he had had the data for some time and had been selling it privately since about late 2015. Peace has previously been connected to sales of similar private information data from other hacks including that from the 2012 LinkedIn hack\n.[10]\n\n[11]\n\nPeace stated the data likely dates back to 2012, and security experts believed it may have been parts of other data hacks at that time; while some of the sample accounts were still active, they lacked necessary information to fully login properly, reflecting their age.[10]\n\nExperts believe that Peace is only a broker of the information that hackers obtain and sell through him.[12]\n\nYahoo! stated they were aware of the data and were evaluating it, cautioning users about the situation but did not reset account passwords at that time.[10]\n\n","The first reported data breach in 2016 had taken place sometime in late 2014, according to Yahoo![13]\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\nThe hackers had obtained data from over 500 million user accounts, including account names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed\npasswords, and in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.Actor'_Hacked_500M_Accounts_16-0\" class=\"reference\"\u003ed_Actor'_Hacked_500M_Accounts-16\"\u003e[16]\n\n[17]\n\nSecurity experts noted that the majority of Yahoo!'s passwords used the bcrypt\nhashing algorithm, which is considered difficult to crack, the rest used the older MD5\nalgorithm which can be broken rather quickly.[18]\n\n","Such information, especially security questions and answers, could help hackers break into victims' other online accounts.[19]\n\n[20]\n\nComputer security\nexperts cautioned that the incident could have far-reaching consequences involving privacy, potentially including finance and banking as well as personal information of people's lives, including information pulled from any other accounts that can be hacked with the gained account data.[1]\n\nExperts also noted that there may be millions of people, as users of Flickr\n, Sky\nand BT\nwho do not realize that they have a Yahoo! account as a result of past acquisitions and agreements made with Yahoo!.[21]\n\nor Yahoo users who stopped using their accounts years earlier.[20]\n\n[22]\n\n[23]\n\n[24]\n\n","Yahoo! reported the breach to the public on September 22, 2016. Yahoo! believes the breach was committed by \"state-sponsored\n\" hackers,[25]\n\nbut did not name any country.[4]\n\nYahoo! affirmed the hacker was no longer in their systems and that the company was fully cooperating with law enforcement.[26]\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) confirmed that it was investigating the affair.[4]\n\n","In its November 2016 SEC\nfiling, Yahoo! reported they had been aware of an intrusion into their network in 2014, but had not understood the extent of the breach until it began investigation of a separate data breach incident around July 2016.[5]\n\n[27]\n\nWired\n\nbelieves this separate data breach involved the Peace data from July 2016.[15]\n\nYahoo!'s previous SEC filing on September 9, prior to the breach announcement, had stated that it was not aware of any \"security breaches\" or \"loss, theft, unauthorized access or acquisition\" of user data.[28]\n\n","The November 2016 SEC filing noted that the company believed the data breach had been conducted through a cookie\n-based attack that allowed hackers to authenticate as any other user without their password.[5]\n\n[6]\n\n[29]\n\nYahoo! and its outside security analysts confirmed this was the method of intrusion in their December 2016 announcement of the August 2013 data breach, and had invalidated all previous cookies to eliminate this route.[2]\n\n[7]\n\n[30]\n\nIn a regulatory filing in 2017, Yahoo! reported that 32 million accounts were accessed through this cookie-based attack through 2015 and 2016.[31]\n\nMultiple experts believe that the security breach was the largest such incident made public in the history of the Internet\nat the time.[4]\n\n[32]\n\n","Another data breach occurred on Yahoo! servers in August 2013; Yahoo! stated this was a separate breach from the late 2014 one and was conducted by an \"unauthorized third party\".[2]\n\nSimilar data as from the late 2014 breach had been taken from over 1 billion user accounts, including unencrypted security questions and answers. Yahoo! reported the breach on December 14, 2016, and forced all affected users to change passwords, and to reenter any unencrypted security questions and answers to make them encrypted in the future.[2]\n\nIn February 2017, Yahoo! notified some users that data from the breach and forged cookies\ncould have been used to access these accounts.[33]\n\nThis breach is now considered the largest known breach of its kind on the Internet.[2]\n\n[34]\n\nIn October 2017, Yahoo! updated its assessment of the hack, and stated that it believes all of its 3 billion accounts at the time of the August 2013 breach were affected.[3]\n\n[35]\n\n","Yahoo! stated that this new breach was discovered while it was reviewing data given to them from law enforcement from an unnamed third-party hacker about a month prior.[36]\n\nThey had been able to identify the method by which data were taken from the last 2014 hack using fake cookies during this investigation, but the method of the August 2013 breach was not clear to them upon their announcement.[2]\n\nAndrew Komarov, chief intelligence officer of the cybersecurity firm InfoArmor, had been helping Yahoo! and law enforcement already in response to the Peace data. In trying to track down the source of Peace's data, he discovered evidence of this latest breach from a dark web\nseller offering a list of more than one billion Yahoo! accounts for about $300,000 in August 2015. While two of the three buyers of this data were found to be underground spammers\n, the third buyer had specifically asked the seller of the Yahoo! data to affirm if ten names of United States and foreign government officials were on the offered list and information associated with them. Suspecting that this buyer may have been related to a foreign intelligence agency, Komarov discovered that the offered data included the accounts of over 150,000 names of people working for the United States government and military, as well as additional accounts associated with European Union, Canadian, British, and Australian governments.[36]\n\n[37]\n\nKomarov alerted the appropriate agencies about this new data set and began working with them directly.[36]\n\nKomarov noted that while U.S. government policies have changed to keep key intelligence employees as low-key as possible, these affected users likely set up Yahoo! accounts for personal use well before such policies were in place, and included their work details as part of their profiles, making this information highly valuable for foreign intelligence groups.[37]\n\nKomarov had opted not to go to Yahoo! about the data, as they had previously been dismissive of InfoArmor's services in the past, and Komarov believed that Yahoo! would not thoroughly investigate the situation as it would threaten their Verizon buyout.[36]\n\n","In addition to government issues, Komarov and other security firms warned that the data from this breach can be used to attempt access to other accounts, since it included backup email contact addresses and security questions. Such data, these experts warn, could be used to create phishing\nattacks to lure users into revealing sensitive information which can then be used for malicious purposes. Hold Security, another cybersecurity firm, observed that some darkweb sellers were still selling this database for up to $200,000 as late as October 2016; Komarov found that the data continues to be available at a much lower price since the passwords have been forced changed, but the data can still be valuable for phishing attacks and gaining access to other accounts.[36]\n\n","According to Yahoo, the 2014 breach was carried out by a \"state-sponsored actor\"[26]\n\nand the organization claims that such \"intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry\".[19]\n\nWhile Yahoo! did not name any country, some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.[4]\n\n[38]\n\n[39]\n\n","U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the Russian government\n.[4]\n\nYahoo! in fall 2014 detected what it believed was a small breach \"involving 30 to 40 accounts\", carried out by hackers believed to be \"working on behalf of the Russian government\", according to Yahoo! executives, because it was launched from computers in that country. Yahoo! reported the incident to the FBI in late 2014 and notified affected users.[40]\n\n","Sean Sullivan, a security adviser at cyber security firm F-Secure\nLabs, declared China to be his top suspect and said that \"there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo! being targeted [by Russia],\" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, or to undermine politicians, while \"China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information\" and \"has a voracious appetite for personal information\".[41]\n\nExamples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion include the massive data breach\n[42]\n\nof 18 million people from the United States Office of Personnel Management\nand the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed Operation Aurora\n.[41]\n\n","Others expressed doubt about Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo! to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a cybercriminal\ngroup or individual—particularly as Yahoo! is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.[38]\n\nSenior research scientist Kenneth Geers from Comodo\n, however, noted that \"Yahoo! is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection\".[38]\n\nOne of the effects, if not the direct goal, of the breaches was the use of the stolen usernames and passwords for credential stuffing\nattacks.[43]\n\n","InfoArmor issued a report that challenged Yahoo's claim that a nation-state orchestrated the heist after reviewing a small sample of compromised accounts.[44]\n\nInfoArmor had been able to obtain the list of affected accounts for analysis. InfoArmor determined that the breach was likely the work of an Eastern European criminal gang that later sold the entire hacked database to at least three clients, including one state-sponsored group. According to InfoArmor, by early 2015, the group no longer offered to sell the full database, but sought \"to extract something from the dump for significant amounts of money.\" The report noted that it was difficult to determine who the ultimate mastermind of a hack might be, as criminal hackers\nsometimes provide information to government intelligence agencies or offer their services for hire. Komarov said the hackers may be related to Group E\n, who have had a track record of selling stolen personal data on the dark web\n, primarily to underground spammers\n, and were previously linked to breaches at LinkedIn, Tumblr, and MySpace.[45]\n\nInfoArmor had linked Group E as the source of the data that were offered by Peace, and believed that Group E was brokering the data to dark web sellers.[12]\n\nWhile InfoArmor did not believe a state-sponsored agency committed the breach, they warned of implications on foreign intelligences, as the breaches \"opens the door to significant opportunities for cyber-espionage and targeted attacks,\" and may be the key in several targeted attacks against U.S. government personnel, which resulted after the disclosed contacts of the affected high-level officials of intelligence community in October 2015.[44]\n\n[46]\n\n","Yahoo! stated that the 2013 breach is connected \"to the same state-sponsored actor believed to be responsible for the data theft the company disclosed on September 22, 2016.\"[34]\n\nWhite House\nspokespersons stated that the FBI is currently investigating this breach, though the scope of its impact is unclear.[47]\n\nA United States official, speaking to CBS News\n, says that government investigators agree with Yahoo! that the hack was sponsored by a foreign state, possibly Russia\n.[48]\n\nSecurity experts speculate that because little of the data from this 2013 breach have been made available on the black market, the breach was likely targeted to find information on specific people.[48]\n\n","On March 15, 2017, the FBI officially charged the 2014 breach to four men, including two that work for Russia's Federal Security Service\n(FSB). In its statement, the FBI said \"The criminal conduct at issue, carried out and otherwise facilitated by officers from an FSB unit that serves as the FBI’s point of contact in Moscow on cybercrime matters, is beyond the pale.\"[49]\n\nThe four men accused include Alexsey Belan\n, a hacker\non the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives\nlist, FSB agents Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin who the FBI accused of paying Belan and other hackers to conduct the hack, and Canadian hacker Karim Baratov who the FBI claimed was paid by Dokuchaev and Sushchin to use data obtained by the Yahoo! breaches to breach into about 80 non-Yahoo! accounts of specific targets.[50]\n\nBaratov, the only man currently arrested, was extradited to the United States, though had claimed not guilty to the charges in August 2017. His plea hearing was to start on November 28, 2017 in San Francisco.[50]\n\n","Yahoo!'s delay in discovering and reporting these breaches, as well as implementing improved security features, has become a point of criticism.[51]\n\nYahoo! has been taken to task for having a seemingly lax attitude towards security: the company reportedly does not implement new security features as fast as other Internet companies, and after Yahoo! was identified by Edward Snowden\nas a frequent target for state-sponsored hackers in 2013, it took the company a full year before hiring a dedicated chief information security officer, Alex Stamos. While Stamos' hiring was praised by technology experts as showing Yahoo!'s commitment towards better security, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer\nhad reportedly denied Stamos and his security team sufficient funds to implement recommended stronger security measures, and he departed the company by 2015. Experts have pointed out that Yahoo!, only until the most recent breaches, had not forced affected users to change their passwords, a move that Mayer and her team believed would drive users away from the service.[52]\n\nSome experts stated that implementing stronger security measures does take monetary resources, and Yahoo!'s financial situation has not allowed the company to invest in cybersecurity.[51]\n\n","Yahoo!'s internal review of the situation found that Mayer and other key executives knew of the intrusions but failed to inform the company or take steps to prevent further breaches. The review led to the resignation of the company's principle lawyer, Ronald S. Bell by March 2017, and Mayer's equity compensation bonus for 2016 and 2017 were pulled.[53]\n\n","In July 2016, prior to the announcement of the breaches Verizon Communications\nhad entered into negotiations and approval to purchase Yahoo! for $4.8 billion, with the deal set to close in March 2017.[32]\n\nVerizon had only become aware of the 2014 breach just two days prior to the Yahoo! September announcement.[4]\n\nCEO Lowell McAdam\nsaid he wasn't shocked by the hack, saying \"we all live in an internet world, it's not a question of if you're going to get hacked but when you are going to get hacked\". He left the door open to possibly renegotiate the $4.83 billion price tag.[54]\n\nCraig Silliman, Verizon's general counsel told reporters in Washington Verizon has \"a reasonable basis to believe right now that the impact is material\" and that they're \"looking to Yahoo to demonstrate [...] the full impact\". The company's reputation has suffered online in the last few months, according to an analysis\nby marketing firm Spredfast: about 90 percent of the Twitter comments about Yahoo! were negative in October, up from 68 percent in August, before news of the hack.[55]\n\nFollowing the announcement of the August 2013 breach, Verizon was reportedly seeking to change terms of the deal to reflect on the impact of these breaches, including lowering their offer or potentially seeking court action as to terminate the deal. Verizon stated that they will \"review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions\".[56]\n\nIn February 2017, Verizon and Yahoo! announced that the deal will still go forward, but dropping the sale price by $350 million, down to $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed at this reduced price in June 2017, with Mayer stepping down as CEO following the closure.[57]\n\nVerizon and Yahoo! will share jointly in the ongoing costs for the government investigation of the breaches under this new term.[58]\n\n","Members of the U.S. Government have been critical of Yahoo!'s reactions to these breaches. In a letter to Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer\n, six Democratic U.S. Senators (Elizabeth Warren\n, Patrick Leahy\n, Al Franken\n, Richard Blumenthal\n, Ron Wyden\nand Ed Markey\n) demanded answers on when Yahoo! discovered the last 2014 breach, and why it took so long to disclose it to the public, calling the time lag between the security breach and its disclosure 'unacceptable'.[59]\n\n[60]\n\n[61]\n\nOn September 26, 2016 democratic senator Mark Warner\nasked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) to investigate whether Yahoo! and its senior executives fulfilled their obligations under federal securities laws to properly disclose the attack. In his letter,[62]\n\nWarner also asked the SEC to evaluate whether the current disclosure regime was adequate. Jacob Olcott, who helped develop the SEC data breach disclosure rules\nand former Senate Commerce Committee counsel, noted that due to the size of the breach, intense public scrutiny and uncertainty over the timing of Yahoo's discovery, the hack could become a test case of the SEC's guidelines.[63]\n\n[64]\n\nFollowing the announcement of the August 2013 breach, Sen. Warner called for a full investigation of the situation, asking \"why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users\".[56]\n\n","By November 9, 2016, it was reported that 23 lawsuits related to the late 2014 breach had been filed against Yahoo! so far.[27]\n\nIn one lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California\nin San Diego\n, the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an \"intrusion into personal financial matters.\" In another lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nin San Jose\n, the plaintiff contends that Yahoo! acted with gross negligence\nin dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo! declined to comment on ongoing litigation.[32]\n\nFive of these 23 cases were combined into a single suit in early December 2016 to be heard in San Jose in March 2017.[65]\n\nThe presiding judge authorized the class-action lawsuit to go forward in August 2017, citing that those affected by the breached had the right to sue Yahoo! for breach of contract and unfair competition claims made in the original filing.[66]\n\nFollowing the December 14 announcement of the August 2013 hacks, another class-action lawsuit was filed against Yahoo! in New York state on behalf of all affected United States residents, stating that \"Yahoo! failed, and continues to fail, to provide adequate protection of its users’ personal and confidential information.\"[67]\n\n","Foreign governments have also expressed concern on these breaches. On October 28, the European privacy regulators \"Article 29 Working Party\" outlined concerns about the 2014 data breach as well as allegations that the company built a system that scanned customers' incoming emails\nat the request of U.S. intelligence services in a letter[68]\n\nto Yahoo.[69]\n\nThey asked Yahoo! to communicate all aspects of the data breach to the EU authorities, to notify the affected users of the \"adverse effects\" and to cooperate with all \"upcoming national data protection authorities' enquiries and/or investigations\".[70]\n\nIn late November, Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner\n(DPC), the lead European regulator on privacy issues for Yahoo! whose European headquarters are in Dublin, said that it had stepped up its examination of the breach, that it was awaiting information from Yahoo! on allegations that it helped the U.S. government scan users' emails, and that Yahoo! was not investigating the breach but just examining it.[71]\n\nGermany's Federal Office for Information Security\ncriticized Yahoo! following the December 2016 announcement, stating \"security is not a foreign concept\", and warned government and other German users to seek email and Internet solutions from companies with better security approaches.[72]\n\n"],"title":"Yahoo!

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df490262df3aa1b2f581"},"content":{"contents":["In June 2015, the United States Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) announced that it had been the target of a data breach\ntargeting the records of as many as four million people.[1]\n\nThe final estimate of the number of stolen records is approximately 21.5 million. This includes records of people who had undergone background checks, but who were not necessarily current or former government employees.[2]\n\nIt has been described by federal officials as among the largest breaches of government data in the history of the United States.[1]\n\nInformation targeted in the breach included personally identifiable information\nsuch as Social Security numbers\n,[3]\n\nas well as names, dates and places of birth, and addresses.[4]\n\n","The data breach consisted of two separate, but linked, attacks.[5]\n\nIt is unclear when the first attack occurred but the second attack happened on May 7, 2014 when attackers posed as an employee of KeyPoint Government Solutions, a subcontracting company. The first attack was discovered March 20, 2014, but the second attack was not discovered until April 15, 2015.[5]\n\n","In the aftermath of the event, Katherine Archuleta\n, the director of OPM, and the CIO, Donna Seymour, resigned.[6]\n\n","On August 27, 2017, the FBI arrested a Chinese national suspected of helping to create the malware used in the breach.[7]\n\n","","","The first breach, named \"X1\" by the Department of Homeland Security\n(DHS), was discovered March 20, 2014 when a third party notified DHS of data exfiltration from OPM's network.[5]\n\n","With regards to the second breach, named \"X2\", the New York Times\nhad reported that the infiltration was discovered using United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team\n(US-CERT)'s Einstein\nintrusion-detection program.[8]\n\nHowever, the Wall Street Journal\n, Wired\n\n, Ars Technica\n\n, and Fortune\nlater reported that it was unclear how the breach was discovered. They reported that it may have been a product demonstration of CyFIR, a commercial forensic product from a Manassas, Virginia\nsecurity company CyTech Services that uncovered the infiltration.[9]\n\n[10]\n\n[11]\n\n[12]\n\nThese reports were subsequently discussed by CyTech Services in a press release issued by the company on June 15, 2015[13]\n\nto clarify contradictions made by OPM spokesman Sam Schumach in a later edit of the Fortune[9]\n\narticle. However, it was not CyTech Services that uncovered the infiltration; rather, it was detected by OPM personnel using a software product of vendor Cylance.[14]\n\n[15]\n\nUltimately, the conclusive House of Representatives' Majority Staff Report on the OPM breach discovered no evidence suggesting that CyTech Services knew of Cylance's involvement or had prior knowledge of an existing breach at the time of its product demonstration, leading to the finding that both tools independently \"discovered\" the malicious code running on the OPM network.[5]\n\n","On June 11, 2015, ABC News also said that highly sensitive 127-page Standard Forms (SF) 86 (Questionnaire for National Security Positions) were put at serious risk by the hack. SF-86 forms contain information about family members, college roommates, foreign contacts, and psychological information. At the time, OPM stated that family members names were not compromised.[16]\n\nHowever, on June 13, 2015, OPM spokesman Samuel Schumach said that investigators had \"a high degree of confidence that OPM systems containing information related to the background investigations of current, former, and prospective federal government employees, to include U.S. military personnel, and those for whom a federal background investigation was conducted, may have been exfiltrated.\"[17]\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency\n, however, does not use the OPM system; therefore, it may not have been affected.[18]\n\n","J. David Cox, president of the American Federation of Government Employees\n, wrote in a letter to OPM director Katherine Archuleta that, based on the incomplete information that the AFGE had received from OPM, \"We believe that the Central Personnel Data File was the targeted database, and that the hackers are now in possession of all personnel data for every federal employee, every federal retiree, and up to one million former federal employees.\"[19]\n\nCox stated that the AFGE believes that the breach compromised military records, veterans' status information, addresses, dates of birth, job and pay history, health insurance and life insurance information, pension information, and data on age, gender, and race.[19]\n\n","The stolen data included 5.6 million sets of fingerprints.[20]\n\nBiometrics expert Ramesh Kesanupalli said that because of this, secret agents were no longer safe, as they could be identified by their fingerprints, even if their names had been changed.[21]\n\n","According to the Wall Street Journal\n, U.S. government officials suspect that Chinese hackers perpetrated the breach.[1]\n\nThe Washington Post\nhas also reported that the attack originated in China, citing unnamed government officials.[4]\n\nChina\nhas responded to these claims by noting that it has been the target of cyberattacks in the past.[22]\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform report on the breach strongly suggested the attackers were state actors due to the use of a very specific and highly-developed piece of malware\n.[5]\n\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\nofficial Andy Ozment testified that the attackers had gained valid user credentials to the systems they were attacking, likely through social engineering\n. The breach also consisted of a malware package which installed itself within OPM’s network and established a backdoor. From there, attackers escalated their privileges to gain access to a wide range of OPM’s systems. Ars Technica\nreported that at least one worker with root access\nto every row\nin every database was physically located in China. Another contractor had two employees with Chinese passports\n.[23]\n\n","Whether the attack was motivated by commercial gain remains unclear.[8]\n\nIt has been suggested that hackers working for the Chinese military intend to compile a database of Americans using the data obtained from the breach.[22]\n\n","The OPM had been warned multiple times of security vulnerabilities and failings. A March 2015 OPM Office of the Inspector General\nsemi-annual report to Congress warned of \"persistent deficiencies in OPM's information system security program,\" including \"incomplete security authorization packages, weaknesses in testing of information security controls, and inaccurate Plans of Action and Milestones.\"[24]\n\n[25]\n\n","A July 2014 story in The New York Times\n\nquoted unnamed senior American officials saying that Chinese hackers had broken into OPM. The officials said that the hackers seemed to be targeting files on workers who had applied for security clearances, and had gained access to several databases, but had been stopped before they obtained the security clearance information. In an interview later that month, Katherine Archuleta\n, the director of OPM, said that the most important thing was that no personal identification information had been compromised.[18]\n\n[26]\n\n[27]\n\n","Some lawmakers made calls for Archuleta to resign citing mismanagement and that she was a political appointee and former Obama campaign official with no degree or experience in human resources\n. She responded that neither she nor OPM chief information officer Donna Seymour would do so. \"I am committed to the work that I am doing at OPM,\" Archuleta told reporters. \"I have trust in the staff that is there.\"[2]\n\nOn July 10, 2015, Archuleta resigned as OPM director.[28]\n\n","Daniel Henninger\n, deputy editorial page director of the Wall Street Journal\n\n, speaking on Fox News\n' Journal Editorial Report\n\n, criticized the appointment of Archuleta to be \"in charge of one of the most sensitive agencies\" in the U.S. government, saying: \"What is her experience to run something like that? She was the national political director of Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. She's also the head of something called the Latina Initiative. She's a politico, right? ... That is the kind of person they have put in.\"[29]\n\n","Security experts have stated that the biggest problem with the breach was not the failure to prevent remote break-ins, but the absence of mechanisms to detect outside intrusion and the lack of proper encryption\nof sensitive data. OPM CIO Donna Seymour countered that criticism by pointed to the agency's aging systems as the primary obstacle to putting such protections in place, despite having encryption tools available. DHS Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications Andy Ozment explained further that, \"If an adversary has the credentials of a user on the network, then they can access data even if it's encrypted, just as the users on the network have to access data, and that did occur in this case. So encryption in this instance would not have protected this data.\"[30]\n\n","A July 22, 2015 memo by Inspector General Patrick McFarland said that OPM's Chief Information Officer Donna Seymour was slowing her investigation into the breach, leading him to wonder whether or not she was acting in good faith. He did not raise any specific claims of misconduct, but he did say that her office was fostering an \"atmosphere of mistrust\" by giving him \"incorrect or misleading\" information.[31]\n\nOn Monday 22 February 2016, CIO Donna Seymour resigned, just two days before she was scheduled to testify before a House panel that is continuing to investigate the data breach.[32]\n\n","FBI Director James Comey\nstated: \"It is a very big deal from a national security perspective and from a counterintelligence perspective. It’s a treasure trove of information about everybody who has worked for, tried to work for, or works for the United States government.\"[33]\n\n","Speaking at a forum in Washington, D.C., Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper\nsaid: \"You have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did.\"[34]\n\n","President-elect Donald Trump\nsaid: \"China, relatively recently, hacked 20 million government names. How come nobody even talks about that?\"[35]\n\n"],"title":"Office of Personnel Management data breach","rels":["/wiki/Cyberwarfare_in_China","/wiki/Operation_Aurora","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches","/wiki/February_2010_Australian_cyberattacks","/wiki/Operation_Aurora","/wiki/Operation_Payback","/wiki/DigiNotar","/wiki/HBGary","/wiki/Operation_AntiSec","/wiki/Operation_Tunisia","/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage","/wiki/RSA_SecurID#March_2011_system_compromise","/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack","/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak","/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack","/wiki/Snapchat#December_2013_hack","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#August_2013_breach","/wiki/Anthem_medical_data_breach","/wiki/Operation_Tovar","/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos","/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack","/wiki/2014_Russian_hacker_password_theft","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach","/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach","/wiki/VTech#2015_data_breach","/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack","/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery","/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center#Ransomware","/wiki/Commission_on_Elections_data_breach","/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack","/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/2017_Westminster_cyberattack","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/2017_cyberattacks_on_Ukraine","/wiki/Equifax#May–July_2017_data_breach","/wiki/Deloitte#2016–17_email_hack","/wiki/Disqus#October_2017_security_breach","/wiki/Anonymous_(group)","/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous","/wiki/Bureau_121","/wiki/Cozy_Bear","/wiki/CyberBerkut","/wiki/Derp_(hacker_group)","/wiki/Equation_Group","/wiki/Fancy_Bear","/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America","/wiki/Goatse_Security","/wiki/Guccifer_2.0","/wiki/Hacking_Team","/wiki/Iranian_Cyber_Army","/wiki/Lizard_Squad","/wiki/LulzRaft","/wiki/LulzSec","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack#Perpetrators","/wiki/NullCrew","/wiki/NSO_Group","/wiki/PayPal_14","/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398","/wiki/PLATINUM_(cybercrime_group)","/wiki/Pranknet","/wiki/RedHack","/wiki/Rocket_Kitten","/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers","/wiki/Syrian_Electronic_Army","/wiki/TeaMp0isoN","/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations","/wiki/UGNazi","/wiki/Yemen_Cyber_Army","/wiki/George_Hotz","/wiki/Guccifer","/wiki/Hector_Monsegur","/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond","/wiki/Junaid_Hussain","/wiki/Kristoffer_von_Hassel","/wiki/Mustafa_Al-Bassam","/wiki/MLT_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Ryan_Ackroyd","/wiki/Topiary_(hacktivist)","/wiki/The_Jester_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Weev","/wiki/Evercookie","/wiki/ISeeYou","/wiki/Heartbleed","/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)","/wiki/POODLE","/wiki/Rootpipe","/wiki/Row_hammer","/wiki/JASBUG","/wiki/Stagefright_(bug)","/wiki/DROWN_attack","/wiki/Badlock","/wiki/Dirty_COW","/wiki/Cloudbleed","/wiki/Broadcom#Vulnerabilities","/wiki/EternalBlue","/wiki/DoublePulsar","/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology#Silent_Bob_is_Silent","/wiki/KRACK","/wiki/ROCA_vulnerability","/wiki/BlueBorne_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Ransomware#Bad_Rabbit","/wiki/Careto_(malware)","/wiki/CryptoLocker","/wiki/Dexter_(malware)","/wiki/Duqu","/wiki/Duqu_2.0","/wiki/FinFisher","/wiki/Flame_(malware)","/wiki/Gameover_ZeuS","/wiki/Mahdi_(malware)","/wiki/Metulji_botnet","/wiki/Mirai_(malware)","/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog","/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club#Staatstrojaner_affair","/wiki/Shamoon","/wiki/Stars_virus","/wiki/Stuxnet","/wiki/Vault_7","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/X-Agent","/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach","/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach"}

Prior to the company's formal establishment, Ornaghi and Valleri (under the aliases of ALoR, and NaGA respectively), created a set of tools that could be used to monitor and remotely manipulate target computers. The program, called Ettercap\n, was embraced both by hackers\nlooking to spy on people, and by companies that hoped to test the security of their own networks.","The Milan police department learned of the tools. Hoping to use Ettercap to spy on Italian citizens and listen to their Skype\ncalls, the police contacted Ornaghi and Valleri and asked them to help modify the program. HackingTeam was born, and became \"the first sellers of commercial hacking software to the police.\"[8]\n\n","According to former employee Alberto Pelliccione, the company began as security services provider, offering penetration testing\n, auditing and other defensive capabilities to clients.[9]\n\nPelliccione states that as malware and other offensive capabilities were developed and accounted for a larger percentage of revenues, the organization pivoted in a more offensive direction and became increasingly compartmentalized. Pelliccione claims fellow employees working on aspects of the same platform – for example, Android exploits and payloads – would not communicate with one another, possibly leading to tensions and strife within the organization.[9]\n\n","In February 2014, a report from Citizen Lab\nidentified the organisation to be using hosting services from Linode\n, Telecom Italia\n, Rackspace\n, NOC4Hosts\nand notorious bullet proof hosting\ncompany Santrex\n.[10]\n\n","On July 5, 2015 the company suffered a major data breach of customer data, software code, internal documents and e-mails. See: § 2015 data breach\n\n","HackingTeam enables clients to perform remote monitoring functions against citizens via their RCS (Remote Control Systems)\n, including their Da Vinci\nand Galileo\nplatforms:[1]\n\n","HackingTeam uses advanced techniques to avoid draining cell phone batteries, which could potentially raise suspicions, and other methods to avoid detection.[15]\n\n[16]\n\n","The malware has payloads for Android\n,[13]\n\nBlackBerry\n, Apple iOS\n, Linux\n, Mac OS X\n, Symbian\n, as well as Microsoft Windows\n, Windows Mobile\nand Windows Phone\nclass of operating systems\n.[17]\n\n","RCS is a management platform that allows operators to remotely deploy exploits and payloads against targeted systems, remotely manage devices once compromised, and exfiltrate data for remote analysis.","HackingTeam has been criticized for selling its products and services to governments with poor human rights records, including Sudan\n, Bahrain\n, Venezuela\n, and Saudi Arabia\n.[18]\n\n","In June 2014, a United Nations panel monitoring the implementation of sanctions on Sudan requested information from HackingTeam about their alleged sales of software to the country in contravention of United Nations weapons export bans to Sudan. Documents leaked in the 2015 data breach of HackingTeam revealed the organization sold Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Service access to their \"Remote Control System\" software in 2012 for 960,000 Euros.[18]\n\n[19]\n\n","In response to the United Nations panel, the company responded in January 2015 that they were not currently selling to Sudan. In a follow-up exchange, HackingTeam asserted that their product was not controlled as a weapon, and so the request was beyond the scope of the panel. There was no need for them to disclose previous sales, which they considered confidential business information.[18]\n\n[20]\n\n","The U.N. disagreed. \"The view of the panel is that as such software is ideally suited to support military electronic intelligence (ELINT) operations it may potentially fall under the category of 'military ... equipment' or 'assistance' related to prohibited items,\" the secretary wrote in March. \"Thus its potential use in targeting any of the belligerents in the Darfur conflict is of interest to the Panel.\"[18]\n\n[21]\n\n","In the fall of 2014, the Italian government abruptly froze all of HackingTeam's exports, citing human rights concerns. After lobbying Italian officials, the company temporarily won back the right to sell its products abroad.[18]\n\n","On July 5, 2015, the Twitter\naccount of the company was compromised by an unknown individual who published an announcement of a data breach\nagainst HackingTeam's computer systems. The initial message read, \"Since we have nothing to hide\n, we're publishing all our e-mails, files, and source code ...\n\" and provided links to over 400 gigabytes\nof data, including alleged internal e-mails, invoices, and source code\n; which were leaked via BitTorrent\nand Mega\n.[22]\n\nAn announcement of the data breach, including a link to the bittorrent seed, was retweeted by WikiLeaks\nand by many others through social media.[23]\n\n[24]\n\n","The material was voluminous and early analysis appeared to reveal that HackingTeam had invoiced the Lebanese Army\n[25]\n\nand Sudan\nand that spy tools were also sold to Bahrain\nand Kazakhstan\n.[24]\n\nHackingTeam had previously claimed they had never done business with Sudan.[26]\n\n","The leaked data revealed a zero-day\ncross-platform Flash exploit (CVE\nnumber: CVE-2015-5119).[27]\n\nThe dump included a demo of this exploit by opening Calculator\nfrom a test webpage.[28]\n\n[29]\n\n[30]\n\nAdobe patched\nthe hole on July 8, 2015.[31]\n\nAnother vulnerability involving Adobe was revealed in the dumps, which took advantage of a buffer overflow\nattack on an Adobe Open Type Manager DLL\nincluded with Microsoft Windows\n.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df4f0262df3aa1b2f583"},"content":{"contents":["In July 2015, a group calling itself \"The Impact Team\" stole the user data of Ashley Madison\n, a commercial website billed as enabling extramarital affairs\n. The group copied personal information about the site's user base and threatened to release users' names and personally identifying information if Ashley Madison was not immediately shut down. On 18 and 20 August, the group leaked more than 25 gigabytes of company data, including user details.","Because of the site's policy of not deleting users' personal information\u0026#160;– including real names, home addresses, search history and credit card transaction records\u0026#160;– many users feared being publicly shamed.[1]\n\n","","","The Impact Team announced the attack on 15 July 2015 and threatened to expose the identities of Ashley Madison's users if its parent company, Avid Life Media\n, did not shut down Ashley Madison and its sister site, \"Established Men\".[2]\n\n","On 20 July 2015, the website put up three statements under its \"Media\" section addressing the breach. The website's normally busy Twitter\naccount fell silent apart from posting the press statements.[3]\n\nOne statement read:","\"At this time, we have been able to secure our sites, and close the unauthorized access points. We are working with law enforcement agencies, which are investigating this criminal act. Any and all parties responsible for this act of cyber-terrorism will be held responsible. Using the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n(DMCA), our team has now successfully removed the posts related to this incident as well as all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about our users published online.\"[4]\n\n","The site also offered to waive the account deletion charge.","Although Ashley Madison denied reports that a mass release of customer records occurred on 21 July,[5]\n\nover 60 gigabytes worth of data was confirmed to be valid on 18 August.[6]\n\nThe information was released on BitTorrent\nin the form of a 10 gigabyte compressed archive and the link to it was posted on a dark web\nsite only accessible via the anonymity network Tor\n.[7]\n\nThe data was cryptographically signed[8]\n\nwith a PGP\nkey. In its message, the group blamed Avid Life Media, accusing the company of deceptive practices: \"We have explained the fraud, deceit, and stupidity of ALM and their members. Now everyone gets to see their data ... Too bad for ALM, you promised secrecy but didn't deliver.\"[9]\n\n","In response, Avid Life Media released a statement that the company was working with authorities to investigate, and said the hackers were not \"hacktivists\n\" but criminals.[10]\n\nA second, larger, data dump occurred on 20 August 2015, the largest file of which comprised 12.7 gigabytes of corporate emails\n, including those of Noel Biderman\n, the CEO of Avid Life Media.[11]\n\n","In July 2017, Avid Life Media (renamed Ruby Corporation) agreed to settle two dozen lawsuits stemming from the breach for $11.2 million.[12]\n\n[13]\n\n","None of the accounts on the website need email verification for the profile to be created, meaning that people often create profiles with fake email addresses, and sometimes people who have similar names accidentally confuse their email address, setting up accounts for the wrong email address. Ashley Madison's company required the owner of the email account to pay money to delete the profile, preventing people who had accounts set up against their consent (as a prank\nor mistyped email) from deleting them without paying.[14]\n\nHackers allege that Avid Life Media received $1.7 million a year from people paying to shut down user profiles created on the site. The company falsely asserted that paying them would \"fully delete\" the profiles, which the hack proved was untrue.[14]\n\n","Following the hack, communities of internet vigilantes\nbegan combing through to find famous individuals, who they planned to publicly humiliate\n.[15]\n\nFrance24 reported that 1,200 Saudi Arabian .sa\nemail addresses were in the leaked database, and in Saudi Arabia adultery can be punished with death.[16]\n\nSeveral thousand U.S. .mil\nand .gov\nemail addresses were registered on the site.[17]\n\n[18]\n\n[19]\n\nIn the days following the breach, extortionists\nbegan targeting people whose details were included in the leak, attempting to scam over US$\n200 worth of Bitcoins\nfrom them.[20]\n\n[21]\n\n[22]\n\nOne company started offering a \"search engine\" where people could type email addresses of colleagues or their spouse into the website, and if the email address was on the database leak, then the company would send them letters threatening that their details were to be exposed unless they paid money to the company.[23]\n\n[24]\n\n","A variety of security researchers and internet privacy\nactivists debated the media ethics\nof journalists reporting on the specifics of the data, such as the names of users revealed to be members.[15]\n\n[25]\n\n[26]\n\n[27]\n\nA number of commentators compared the hack to the loss of privacy during the 2014 celebrity photo hack\n.[28]\n\n[29]\n\n","Clinical psychologists argued that dealing with an affair in a particularly public way increases the hurt for spouses and children.[30]\n\nCarolyn Gregoire argued that \"Social media has created an aggressive culture of public shaming in which individuals take it upon themselves to inflict psychological damage\" and that more often than not, \"the punishment goes beyond the scope of the crime.\"[30]\n\nGraham Cluley\nargued that the psychological consequences for people shamed could be immense, and that it would be possible for some to be bullied into suicide.[31]\n\n[32]\n\nCharles J. Orlando, who had joined the site to conduct research concerning women who cheat, said he felt users of the site were anxious the release of sexually explicit messages would humiliate their spouses and children.[33]\n\nHe wrote it is alarming \"the mob\nthat is the Internet is more than willing to serve as judge, jury, and executioner\" and members of the site \"don’t deserve a flogging in the virtual town square with millions of onlookers.\"[33]\n\n","On 24 August 2015, Toronto\npolice announced that two unconfirmed suicides had been linked to the data breach, in addition to \"reports of hate crimes connected to the hack.\"[34]\n\n[35]\n\nUnconfirmed reports say a man in the U.S. died by suicide.[23]\n\nAt least one suicide, which was previously linked to Ashley Madison, has since been reported as being due to \"stress entirely related to issues at work that had no connection to the data leak\".[36]\n\n","On 24 August 2015, a pastor and professor at the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary\ncommitted suicide citing the leak that had occurred six days before.[37]\n\n","Users whose details were leaked are filing a $567 million class-action lawsuit against Avid Dating Life and Avid Media, the owners of Ashley Madison, through Canadian law firms Charney Lawyers and Sutts, Strosberg LLP.[38]\n\nIn July 2017, the owner of Ruby Corp.\nannounced the company would settle the lawsuit for $11.2 million.[39]\n\n","Annalee Newitz\n, editor-in-chief of Gizmodo\n\n, analyzed the leaked data.[40]\n\nShe initially found that only roughly 12,000 of the 5.5 million registered female accounts were used on a regular basis, equal to 3 in every 1000, or less than 1%.[41]\n\n[42]\n\nThe remaining were used only one time, the day they were registered. She also found that a very high number of the women's accounts were created from the same IP address suggesting there were many fake accounts. She found women checked email messages very infrequently: for every 1 time a woman checked her email, 13,585 men checked theirs. Only 9,700 of the 5 million female account had ever replied to a message, compared to the 5.9 million men who would do the same. She concluded that, \"The women's accounts show so little activity that they might as well not be there\".[41]\n\nIn a subsequent article the following week Newitz acknowledged that she had \"misunderstood the evidence\" in her previous article, and that her conclusion that there were few females active on the site had actually been based on data recording \"bot\" activities in contacting members. She notes that \"we have absolutely no data recording human activity at all in the Ashley Madison database dump from Impact Team. All we can see is when fake humans contacted real ones.\" [43]\n\n","Passwords on the live site were hashed\nusing the bcrypt\nalgorithm.[44]\n\n[45]\n\nA security analyst using the Hashcat\npassword recovery tool with a dictionary\nbased on the RockYou passwords found that among the 4,000 passwords that were the easiest to crack, \"123456\" and \"password\" were the most commonly used passwords on the live website. An analysis of old passwords used on an archived version showed that \"123456\" and \"password\" were the most common.[46]\n\nDue to a design error where passwords were hashed with both bcrypt\nand md5\n, 11 million passwords were eventually cracked.[47]\n\n","Claire Brownell suggested that the Turing test\ncould be possibly passed by the women-imitating chatbots\nthat fooled millions of men into buying special accounts.[48]\n\n"],"title":"Ashley Madison data

In the first year, turnover was less than US$1 million.[8]\n\n","VTech initially focused on developing video games\n. In 1977, the company created its first home TV game console, a version of Pong\n. Since only consumers in North America and Europe could afford such items, the company targeted primarily these markets.","The United Kingdom was chosen as the first market for Pong, as Hong Kong and the UK used the same standard for television systems\n. In 1978, the founders introduced LED games they had developed to buyers from RadioShack\nin the US, which were sold under the RadioShack brand.","VTech then began to build its own brand. VTech unveiled its first electronic learning product, called \"Lesson One\", at the New York Toy Fair, in February 1980.[8]\n\nIt taught children basic spelling and maths. An exclusive version under the name \"Computron\" was offered to Sears\n, with the product being prominently advertised by Sears, in its catalogue, which was a popular shopping guide.outh-2_14-0\" class=\"reference\"\u003e_Youth-2-14\"\u003e[14]\n\n[15]\n\n","Next VTech made the video game console CreatiVision\n.","VTech then branched out into personal computers\n, including a series of IBM compatible PCs\nbeginning in 1983, followed by Apple II\ncompatible computers, beginning in 1985, including a model called Laser 128\n.","VTech exited the personal computer market in 1997, due to tight competition.[16]\n\n","In 1985, the United States Federal Communications Commission\n(FCC) allocated the frequency band 900MHz\nto ISM\n(industrial, scientific and medical) devices. Taking advantage of this, VTech began development on a cordless telephone, using the 900\u0026#160;MHz band, and in 1991 introduced the world's first fully digital\n900\u0026#160;MHz cordless telephone.[17]\n\n[18]\n\n","In 2000, to expand its cordless phone business, VTech acquired the consumer telephone business of Lucent Technologies\n. The acquisition also gave VTech the exclusive right for 10 years to use the AT\u0026amp;T\nbrand in conjunction with the manufacture and sale of wireline telephones and accessories in the United States and Canada.[19]\n\nAlthough the acquisition increased sales of VTech's telecommunication products by 50%, it led to operating losses and write-offs\n. The company issued a profit warning\nin March 2001 and launched a broad restructuring\nplan.[20]\n\nBy the financial year\n2002, the company had turned around the business and returned to profitability\n.[21]\n\n","Today, VTech's core businesses\nremain cordless telephones and electronic learning products. Its contract manufacturing\nservices – which manufactures various electronic products on behalf of medium-sized companies, has also become a major source of revenue. The company has diversified geographically, selling to North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.[22]\n\n","In November 2015, Lorenzo Bicchierai, writing for Vice\nmagazine's\nMotherboard\n, reported that VTech's servers had been compromised and the corporation was victim to a data breach\nwhich exposed personal data belonging to 6.3 million individuals, including children, who signed up for or utilized services provided by the company related to several products it manufactures.[23]\n\nBicchierai was contacted by the unnamed attacker in late November, during the week before Thanksgiving\n, at which point the unnamed individual disclosed information about the security vulnerabilities\nwith the journalist and detailed the breach.[24]\n\n","Bicchierai then reached out to information security\nresearcher Troy Hunt\nto examine data provided by the attacker to Bicchierai, and to confirm if the leak was indeed authentic and not an internet hoax\n. Hunt examined the information and confirmed it appeared to be authentic. Hunt then dissected the data in detail and published the findings on his website. According to Hunt, VTech's servers failed to utilize basic SSL\nencryption\nto secure the personal data in transit\nfrom the devices to VTech's servers; that VTech stored customer information in unencrypted plaintext\n, failed to securely hash\nor salt\npasswords.[25]\n\n","The attack leveraged an SQL injection\nto gain privileged root access\nto VTech servers. Once privileged access was acquired, the attacker exfiltrated the data, including some 190 gigabytes\nof photographs of children and adults, detailed chat logs\nbetween parents and children which spanned over the course of years and voice recordings, all unencrypted and stored in plain text. The attacker shared some 3,832 image files with the journalist for verification purposes, and some redacted\nphotographs were published by the journalist. Commenting on the leak, the unnamed attacker expressed their disgust with being able to so easily obtain access to such a large trove of data, saying: \"Frankly, it makes me sick that I was able to get all this stuff. VTech should have the book thrown at them” and explained their rationale for going to the press was because they felt VTech would have ignored their reports and concerns.[26]\n\n[27]\n\n","VTech corporate security was unaware their systems had been compromised and the breach was first brought to their attention after being contacted by Bicchierai prior to publication of the article. Upon notification, the company took a dozen or so websites and services offline.[24]\n\n[26]\n\n","In an FAQ\npublished by the company, they explain some 4,854,209 accounts belonging to parents and 6,368,509 profiles belonging to children had been compromised. The company further claims the passwords had been encrypted, which is contrary to reports by the independent security researcher contacted by Vice\n. The company indicated they were working with unspecified \"local authorities.\"[28]\n\n[25]\n\nVTech subsequently brought in the information security services company FireEye\nto manage incident response\nand audit the security of their platform going forward.[29]\n\n","Mark Nunnikhoven of Trend Micro\ncriticized the company's handling of the incident and called their FAQ \"wishy-washy corporate speak.\"[30]\n\n","United States Senators\nEdward Markey\nand Joe Barton\n, co-founders of the Bi-Partisan Congressional Privacy Caucus, issued an open letter\nto the company inquiring as to why and what kind of information belonging to children is stored by VTech and how they use this data, security practices employed to protect that data, if children's information is shared or sold to third-parties and how the company complies with the cy_Protection_Act\" title=\"Children's Online Privacy Protection Act\"\u003eChildren's Online Privacy Protection Act\n.[31]\n\n","In February 2016, Hunt publicized the fact that VTech had modified its Terms and Conditions for new customers so that the customer acknowledges and agrees that any information transmitted to VTech may be intercepted or later acquired by unauthorized parties.[32]\n\n[33]\n\n","In January 2018 the US Federal Trade Commission\nfined VTech $650,000 USD for the breach, around $0.09 per victim.[34]\n\n","VTech was among the pioneers of the ELP industry, beginning in 1980 with a unit designed to teach children basic spelling\nand mathematics\n.[35]\n\n","Today VTech is a leading global supplier of ELPs from infancy to preschool,class=\"reference\"\u003e[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\nmaking both individual standalone products and platform products that combine a variety of consoles\nwith different software\n.p id=\"cite_ref-Silicon's_Search_For_Youth_12-1\" class=\"reference\"\u003ehref=\"#cite_note-Silicon's_Search_For_Youth-12\"\u003e[12]\n\n","p id=\"cite_ref-Silicon's_Search_For_Youth_12-1\" class=\"reference\"\u003ehref=\"#cite_note-Silicon's_Search_For_Youth-12\"\u003e[12]\n","href=\"#cite_note-Silicon's_Search_For_Youth-12\"\u003e[12]","Its V.Smile\nTV Learning System, which was launched in 2004, established what the company calls platform products as an important category within its ELPs.[36]\n\nLatest additions to the platform product range are InnoTab Max,[37]\n\n[38]\n\nKidizoom Smart Watch\n[39]\n\nand InnoTV.[40]\n\n[41]\n\n","VTech introduced the world's first 900\u0026#160;MHz and 5.8\u0026#160;GHz cordless phones in 1991 and 2002 respectively.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df550262df3aa1b2f585"},"content":{"contents":["In 2015 and 2016, a series of cyberattacks\nusing the SWIFT banking network\n\nwere reported, resulting in the successful theft of millions of dollars.[1]\n\n[2]\n\nThe attacks were perpetrated by a hacker group nicknamed \"Lazarus\" by researchers. The group, which is also considered responsible for the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack\n, has been linked to North Korea\n. If the attribution to North Korea is accurate, it would be the first known incident of a state actor using cyberattacks to steal funds.","The attacks exploited vulnerabilities in the systems of member banks, allowing the attackers to gain control of the banks' legitimate SWIFT credentials. The thieves then used those credentials to send SWIFT funds transfer requests to other banks, which, trusting the messages to be legitimate, then sent the funds to accounts controlled by the attackers.[1]\n\n","","","The first public reports of these attacks came from thefts from Bangladesh\ncentral bank and a bank in Vietnam.","A $101 million theft\nfrom the Bangladesh\ncentral bank via its account at the New York Federal Reserve Bank\nwas traced to hacker\npenetration of SWIFT's Alliance Access\nsoftware, according to a New York Times\nreport. It was not the first such attempt, the society acknowledged, and the security of the transfer system was undergoing new examination accordingly.[3]\n\n[4]\n\n","Soon after the reports of the theft from the Bangladesh central bank, a second, apparently related, attack was reported to have occurred on a commercial bank in Vietnam.[1]\n\n","Both attacks involved malware\nwritten to both issue unauthorized SWIFT messages and to conceal that the messages had been sent. After the malware sent the SWIFT messages that stole the funds, it deleted the database record of the transfers then took further steps to prevent confirmation messages from revealing the theft. In the Bangladeshi case, the confirmation messages would have appeared on a paper report; the malware altered the paper reports when they were sent to the printer. In the second case, the bank used a PDF report; the malware altered the PDF viewer to hide the transfers.[1]\n\n","Furthermore, news agency Reuters\nreported on 20 May 2016 that there had already been a similar case in Ecuador in early 2015 when Banco del Austro\nfunds were transferred to bank accounts in Hong Kong\n. Neither Banco del Austro nor Wells Fargo\n, who were asked to conduct the transactions, initially reported the movements to SWIFT as suspicious; implications that the actions actually were a theft only emerged during a BDA lawsuit filed against Wells Fargo.[2]\n\n","After the initial two reports, two security firms reported that the attacks involved malware similar to that used in the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack\nand impacted as many at 12 banks in Southeast Asia.[5]\n\n[6]\n\nBoth attacks are attributed to a hacker group nicknamed Lazarus Group\nby researchers. Symantec\nhas linked the group with North Korea\n.[7]\n\nIf North Korea's involvement is true, it would be the first known incident of a state actor using cyberattacks to steal funds.[8]\n\n[9]\n\n","If the attack did originate in North Korea, the thefts would have profound implications for international relations. It would be the first known instance of a state actor using cyber attacks to steal funds.[9]\n\n","The thefts may also have implications for the regime of international sanctions that aim to isolate North Korea's economy. The theft may represent a significant percentage of North Korea's current GDP.[9]\n\n","Trust in the SWIFT system has an important element in international banking\nfor decades. Banks consider SWIFT messages trustworthy, and can thus follow the transmitted instructions immediately. In addition, the thefts themselves can threaten the solvency of the member banks.[5]\n\n\"This is a big deal, and it gets to the heart of banking,\" said SWIFT's CEO, Gottfried Leibbrandt, who added, \"Banks that are compromised like this can be put out of business.\"[5]\n\n","Following the attacks, SWIFT announced a new regime of mandatory controls required of all banks using the system.[10]\n\nSWIFT will inspect member banks for compliance, and inform regulators and other banks of noncompliance.","SWIFT officials have made repeated remarks that attacks on the system are expected to continue.[4]\n\n[10]\n\nIn September 2016, SWIFT announced that three additional banks had been attacked. In two of the cases, the hackers succeeded in sending fraudulent SWIFT orders, but the receiving banks found them to be suspicious and discovered the fraud. According to SWIFT officials, in the third case, a patch to the SWIFT software allowed the attacked bank to detect the hackers before messages were sent.[10]\n\n"],"title":"2015–2016 SWIFT banking hack","rels":["/wiki/February_2010_Australian_cyberattacks","/wiki/Operation_Aurora","/wiki/Operation_Payback","/wiki/DigiNotar","/wiki/HBGary","/wiki/Operation_AntiSec","/wiki/Operation_Tunisia","/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage","/wiki/RSA_SecurID#March_2011_system_compromise","/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack","/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak","/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack","/wiki/Snapchat#December_2013_hack","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#August_2013_breach","/wiki/Anthem_medical_data_breach","/wiki/Operation_Tovar","/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos","/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack","/wiki/2014_Russian_hacker_password_theft","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach","/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach","/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach","/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach","/wiki/VTech#2015_data_breach","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery","/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center#Ransomware","/wiki/Commission_on_Elections_data_breach","/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack","/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/2017_Westminster_cyberattack","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/2017_cyberattacks_on_Ukraine","/wiki/Equifax#May–July_2017_data_breach","/wiki/Deloitte#2016–17_email_hack","/wiki/Disqus#October_2017_security_breach","/wiki/Anonymous_(group)","/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous","/wiki/Bureau_121","/wiki/Cozy_Bear","/wiki/CyberBerkut","/wiki/Derp_(hacker_group)","/wiki/Equation_Group","/wiki/Fancy_Bear","/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America","/wiki/Goatse_Security","/wiki/Guccifer_2.0","/wiki/Hacking_Team","/wiki/Iranian_Cyber_Army","/wiki/Lizard_Squad","/wiki/LulzRaft","/wiki/LulzSec","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack#Perpetrators","/wiki/NullCrew","/wiki/NSO_Group","/wiki/PayPal_14","/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398","/wiki/PLATINUM_(cybercrime_group)","/wiki/Pranknet","/wiki/RedHack","/wiki/Rocket_Kitten","/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers","/wiki/Syrian_Electronic_Army","/wiki/TeaMp0isoN","/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations","/wiki/UGNazi","/wiki/Yemen_Cyber_Army","/wiki/George_Hotz","/wiki/Guccifer","/wiki/Hector_Monsegur","/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond","/wiki/Junaid_Hussain","/wiki/Kristoffer_von_Hassel","/wiki/Mustafa_Al-Bassam","/wiki/MLT_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Ryan_Ackroyd","/wiki/Topiary_(hacktivist)","/wiki/The_Jester_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Weev","/wiki/Evercookie","/wiki/ISeeYou","/wiki/Heartbleed","/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)","/wiki/POODLE","/wiki/Rootpipe","/wiki/Row_hammer","/wiki/JASBUG","/wiki/Stagefright_(bug)","/wiki/DROWN_attack","/wiki/Badlock","/wiki/Dirty_COW","/wiki/Cloudbleed","/wiki/Broadcom#Vulnerabilities","/wiki/EternalBlue","/wiki/DoublePulsar","/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology#Silent_Bob_is_Silent","/wiki/KRACK","/wiki/ROCA_vulnerability","/wiki/BlueBorne_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Ransomware#Bad_Rabbit","/wiki/Careto_(malware)","/wiki/CryptoLocker","/wiki/Dexter_(malware)","/wiki/Duqu","/wiki/Duqu_2.0","/wiki/FinFisher","/wiki/Flame_(malware)","/wiki/Gameover_ZeuS","/wiki/Mahdi_(malware)","/wiki/Metulji_botnet","/wiki/Mirai_(malware)","/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog","/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club#Staatstrojaner_affair","/wiki/Shamoon","/wiki/Stars_virus","/wiki/Stuxnet","/wiki/Vault_7","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/X-Agent","/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack","/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df580262df3aa1b2f586"},"content":{"contents":["The Bangladesh Bank robbery\n, also known colloquially as the Bangladesh Bank heist\n, took place in February 2016, when instructions to fraudulently withdraw US$\n1 billion \u0026#160;from the account of Bangladesh Bank\n, the central bank of Bangladesh, at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were issued via the SWIFT network\n. Five transactions issued by security hackers\n, worth $101\u0026#160;million and withdrawn from a Bangladesh Bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n, succeeded, with $20\u0026#160;million traced to Sri Lanka\n(since recovered) and $81\u0026#160;million to the Philippines\n(about $18 million recovered).[1]\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York blocked the remaining thirty transactions, amounting to $850\u0026#160;million, at the request of Bangladesh Bank.[2]\n\nIt was identified later that Dridex\nmalware was used for the attack.[3]\n\n","","","The 2016 cyber-attack on the Bangladesh Central bank was not the first attack of its kind. In this \"cyber heist\", thieves tried to illegally transfer US$951 million to several fictitious bank accounts around the world. In 2013, the Sonali Bank of Bangladesh was also successfully targeted by hackers who were able to cart away US$250,000. In 2015, two other hacking attempts were recorded, a $12 million theft from Banco del Austro in Ecuador in January and an attack on Vietnam's Tien Phong Bank in December that was not successful. In all these cases, the perpetrators are suspected to have been aided by insiders within the targeted banks, who assisted in taking advantage of weaknesses at the targeted banks giving access to the SWIFT global payment network\n.[4]\n\n[5]\n\n","Capitalizing on weaknesses in the security of the Bangladesh Central Bank, including the possible involvement of some of its employees,[6]\n\nperpetrators attempted to steal $951 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nsometime between February 4–5 when Bangladesh Bank's offices were closed\n. The perpetrators managed to compromise Bangladesh Bank's computer network, observe how transfers are done, and gain access to the bank's credentials for payment transfers. They used these credentials to authorise about three dozen requests to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to transfer funds from the account Bangladesh Bank held there to accounts in Sri Lanka and the Philippines.","Thirty transactions worth $851\u0026#160;million were flagged by the banking system for staff review, but five requests were granted; $20 million to Sri Lanka (later recovered[7]\n\n[8]\n\n), and $81 million lost to the Philippines, entering the Southeast Asian country's banking system on February 5, 2016. This money was laundered through casinos and some later transferred to Hong Kong\n.","The $20 million transfer to Sri Lanka was intended by hackers to be sent to the Shalika Foundation, a Sri Lanka-based private limited company\n. The hackers misspelled \"Foundation\" in their request to transfer the funds, spelling the word as \"Fundation\". This spelling error gained suspicion from Deutsche Bank\n, a routing bank which put a halt to the transaction in question after seeking clarifications from Bangladesh Bank.[7]\n\n[9]\n\n[10]\n\n","Sri Lanka-based Pan Asia Bank\ninitially took notice of the transaction, with one official noting the transaction as too big for a country like Sri Lanka. Pan Asia Bank was the one which referred the anomalous transaction to Deutsche Bank. The Sri Lankan funds have been recovered by Bangladesh Bank.[7]\n\n","The money transferred to the Philippines was deposited in five separate accounts with the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation\n(RCBC); the accounts were later found to be under fictitious identities. The funds were then transferred to a foreign exchange broker to be converted to Philippine pesos, returned to the RCBC and consolidated in an account of a Chinese-Filipino businessman;[11]\n\n[8]\n\nthe conversion was made from February 5 to 13, 2016.[12]\n\nIt was also found that the four U.S. dollar accounts involved were opened at the RCBC as early as May 15, 2015, remaining untouched until February 4, 2016, the date the transfer from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was made.[12]\n\n","On February 8, 2016, during the Chinese New Year\n, Bangladesh Bank through SWIFT\ninformed RCBC to stop the payment, refund the funds, and to \"freeze and put the funds on hold\" if the funds had already been transferred. Chinese New Year is a non-working holiday in the Philippines and a SWIFT message from Bangladesh Bank containing similar information was received by RCBC only a day later. By this time, a withdrawal amounting to about $58.15 million had already been processed by RCBC's Jupiter Street (in Makati City\n) branch.[12]\n\n","On February 16, the Governor of Bangladesh Bank requested Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\n' assistance in the recovery of its $81 million funds, saying that the SWIFT payment instructions issued in favor of RCBC on February 4, 2016 were fraudulent.[12]\n\n","Initially, Bangladesh Bank was uncertain if its system had been compromised. The governor of the central bank engaged World Informatix Cyber Security, a US based firm, to lead the security incident response, vulnerability assessment and remediation. World Informatix Cyber Security brought in the forensic investigation company Mandiant\n, for the investigation. These investigators found \"footprints\" and malware of hackers, which suggested that the system had been breached. The investigators also said that the hackers were based outside Bangladesh. An internal investigation has been launched by Bangladesh Bank regarding the case.[7]\n\n","The Bangladesh Bank's forensic investigation found out that malware was installed within the bank's system sometime in January 2016, and gathered information on the bank's operational procedures for international payments and fund transfers.[12]\n\n","The investigation also looked into an unsolved 2013 hacking incident at the Sonali Bank, wherein US$250,000 was stolen by still unidentified hackers. According to reports, just as in the 2016 Central Bank hack, the theft also used fraudulent fund transfers using the SWIFT International Payment Network. The incident was treated by Bangladeshi police authorities as a cold-case until the suspiciously similar 2016 Bangladesh Central Bank robbery.[13]\n\n","The Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation\n(NBI) launched a probe and looked into a Chinese-Filipino who allegedly played a key role in the money laundering of the illicit funds. The NBI is coordinating with relevant government agencies including the country's Anti-Money Laundering Council\n(AMLC). The AMLC started its investigation on February 19, 2016 of bank accounts linked to a junket\noperator.[12]\n\nAMLC has filed a money laundering complaint before the Department of Justice\nagainst a RCBC branch manager and five unknown persons with fictitious names in connection with the case.[14]\n\n","A Philippine Senate\nhearing was held on March 15, 2016, led by Senator Teofisto Guingona III\n, head of the Blue Ribbon Committee\nand Congressional Oversight Committee on the Anti-Money Laundering Act.[15]\n\nA closed-door hearing was later held on March 17.[16]\n\nPhilippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation\n(PAGCOR) has also launched its own investigation.[7]\n\nOn August 12, 2016, RCBC was reported to have paid half of the Ph₱1 billion penalty imposed by the Central Bank of the Philippines.[17]\n\nPrior to that, the bank reorganized its board of directors by increasing the number of independent directors to 7 from the previous 4.[18]\n\n","FireEye\n's Mandiant forensics division and World Informatix Cyber Security, both US-based companies, are investigating the hacking case. According to investigators, the perpetrators' familiarity with the internal procedures of Bangladesh Bank was probably gained by spying on its workers. In a separate report, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) says that Agents have found evidence pointing to at least one bank employee acting as an accomplice, with evidence pointing to several more people as possibly assisting hackers in navigate the Bangladesh Bank’s computer system.[19]\n\nThe government of Bangladesh is considering suing the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in a bid to recover the stolen funds.[7]\n\n","Federal prosecutors in the United States have revealed possible links between the government of North Korea\nand the theft.[20]\n\nU.S. prosecutors are reportedly at work building potential cases that would accuse North Korea of directing the theft of $81 million from Bangladesh Bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The report also said that to be included in the charges are \"alleged Chinese middlemen,\" who facilitated the transfer of the funds after it had been diverted to the Philippines.[21]\n\n","Some security companies, including Symantec Corp\n. and BAE Systems Plc\n, say that the North Korea-based Lazarus Group\n, one of the world’s most active state-sponsored hacking collectives, were probably behind the attack. They cite similarities between the methods used in the Bangladesh heist and those in other cases, such as the hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment\nin 2014, which U.S. officials also attributed to North Korea. Cybersecurity experts say Lazarus Group was also behind the WannaCry\nransomware attack in May that infected hundreds of thousands of computers around the world[22]\n\n.","Some or all of the stolen funds may eventually have found its way to North Korea\n. The FBI is examining the totalitarian state’s link to the hack, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the investigation[23]\n\n.","US National Security Agency\nDeputy Director Richard Ledgett\nwas also quoted as saying that, “If that linkage from the Sony actors to the Bangladeshi bank actors is accurate — that means that a nation state is robbing banks.\"[24]\n\n","Computer security researchers have linked the theft to as many as eleven other attacks\n, and alleged that North Korea\nhad a role in the attacks, which, if true, would be the first known incident of a state actor using cyberattacks to steal funds.[25]\n\n[26]\n\n","The Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation said it did not tolerate the illicit activity in the RCBC branch involved in the case. Lorenzo V. Tan\n, RCBC's president, said that the bank cooperated with the Anti-Money Laundering Council and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas regarding the matter.[27]\n\nTan's legal counsel has asked the RCBC Jupiter Street branch manager to explain the alleged fake bank account that was used in the money laundering scam.[28]\n\n","The RCBC's board committee also launched a separate probe into the bank's involvement in the money laundering scam. RCBC president Lorenzo V. Tan filed an indefinite leave of absence to give way to the investigation by the authorities on the case.[29]\n\n[30]\n\nOn May 6, 2016, despite being cleared of any wrongdoing by the bank's internal investigation, Tan resigned as President of RCBC to \"take full moral responsibility\" for the incident.[31]\n\n[32]\n\nHelen Yuchengco-Dee, daughter of RCBC founder Alfonso Yuchengco, will take over the bank's operations. The bank also apologized to the public for its involvement in the robbery.","Bangladesh Bank chief governor Atiur Rahman\nresigned from his post amid the current investigation of the robbery and money laundering. He submitted his resignation letter to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\non March 15, 2016. Before the resignation was made public, Rahman stated that he would resign for the sake of his country.[33]\n\n","On August 5, 2016, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\napproved a ₱1 billion\n(~US$52.92 million) fine against RCBC for its non-compliance with banking laws and regulations in connection with the bank robbery. This is the largest monetary fine ever approved by BSP against any institution. RCBC stated that the bank will comply with the BSP's decision, and will pay the imposed fine.[34]\n\n","The incident shows the risks that banks connected to the SWIFT system are exposed to as a result of the security vulnerabilities of other member banks. By breaching the Bangladesh Central Bank's security firewalls, hackers were able to hack the system and transfer the funds through the established global banking networks almost undetected. The failure of the Bangladeshi government to build adequate safeguards for its financial system became the starting point for a global, multi-million money laundering scheme whose effect was felt beyond the country's borders.","The case threatens the reinstatement of the Philippines to the blacklist\n, by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering\n, of countries making insufficient efforts against money laundering.[35]\n\nAttention was given to a potential weakness of Philippine authorities' efforts against money laundering after lawmakers in 2012 managed to exclude casinos from the roster of organizations required to report to the Anti-Money Laundering Council\nregarding suspicious transactions.","The case also highlights the threat of cyber attacks to both government and private institutions by cyber criminals using real bank codes to make orders look genuine. SWIFT has advised banks using the SWIFT Alliance Access system to strengthen their cyber security posture and ensure they are following SWIFT security guidelines. Bangladesh is reportedly the 20th most cyber-attacked country, according to a cyber threat map developed by Kaspersky Lab, which runs in real time.[36]\n\n"],"title":"Bangladesh Bank

The hospital has 434 beds.","","","Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, was an acute-care facility that has been caring for the Hollywood community and surrounding areas since 1924. The hospital is committed to serve local, multicultural communities with qualified medical and nursing care.","In 2004, HPMC joined the CHA Medical Group and renamed it CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center is the first Korean-owned and operated general hospital in the United States. The hospital is an acute-care 7-building facility with 434 licensed beds, 1,400 employees and an 800-member medical staff. With more than 500 physicians representing nearly every specialty, CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center distinguishes itself as a leading healthcare facility recognized for providing qualified, innovative care in a compassionate manner.","CHA Hollywood Medical Center is an accredited Primary Stroke Center certified by the Joint Commission and is baby-friendly, where all mothers and newborn infants remain together after delivery to create strong bonds.","Recently there has been a major improvement in ED services for patients. It is divided into three tracks according to the severity of the symptoms to provide fast emergency services. This allows patients to receive shorter waiting times and immediate treatment.","CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center has been recognized by Healthgrades for 1 Hospital Quality Award (Patient Safety) and 2 Clinical Quality Awards (Labor and Delivery, Obstetrics and Gynecology) in 2017. CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center has earned the Get With The Guidelines® - Stroke GOLD PLUS Quality Achievement Award and is also qualified for recognition on the Target: Stroke Honor Roll Elite Plus.","The master plan is designed to expand and modernize its facility in order to better serve the Hollywood community and surrounding areas. The project will also be a plan to fulfill the state’s seismic safety mandate that all hospitals must meet by 2020.","The initial project will be anchored by a new emergency department, as the hospital has chosen to construct an entirely new ED rather than to retrofit the existing structure. The new ED will include increasing the current 20 beds to 26 beds and doubling the size of the department’s physical space from its current 11,000 to 26,000 square feet. The department is being expressly designed to enhance patients' experience from the moment a patient walks through the door. The hospital’s emergency department is staffed by a trained, multi-lingual team of physicians, nurses and ancillary staff to make a unique, culturally sensitive resource for the community. Also included in Phase 1 of the master plan is building a new 650-spot parking structure for patients, employees and visitors and beautifying overall internal and external designs of the hospital campus. In addition, the hospital will rebuild and relocate its kitchen and dietary department, which serves patients, visitors and employees. Immediately upon its completion, the construction of the new emergency department will begin, with an anticipated completion date of fall 2019.","In February 2007, an investigation was launched after a hospital official allegedly \"dumped\" 54-year-old Gabino Olvera, a paraplegic\npatient, on a Skid Row\nstreet. According to witnesses, Olvera was removed from a hospital van and was left writhing in a gutter, wearing nothing more than a soiled gown and a broken colostomy bag\n.[2]\n\nThe hospital agreed to pay US$\n1,000,000 and be monitored for up to 5 years as part of a settlement agreement\nreached in 2008.[3]\n\n","In 2016, the hospitals computer system was hijacked by ransomware\nforcing the hospital to use paper. Patients were asked to pick up lab results in person. The hospital paid a 40 bitcoin\nransom that was then worth approximately US$\n17,000 to the hackers to regain access to their system.[4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n\n"],"title":"Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center","rels":["/wiki/February_2010_Australian_cyberattacks","/wiki/Operation_Aurora","/wiki/Operation_Payback","/wiki/DigiNotar","/wiki/HBGary","/wiki/Operation_AntiSec","/wiki/Operation_Tunisia","/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage","/wiki/RSA_SecurID#March_2011_system_compromise","/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack","/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak","/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack","/wiki/Snapchat#December_2013_hack","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#August_2013_breach","/wiki/Anthem_medical_data_breach","/wiki/Operation_Tovar","/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos","/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack","/wiki/2014_Russian_hacker_password_theft","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach","/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach","/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach","/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach","/wiki/VTech#2015_data_breach","/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack","/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery","/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center#Ransomware","/wiki/Commission_on_Elections_data_breach","/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack","/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/2017_Westminster_cyberattack","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/2017_cyberattacks_on_Ukraine","/wiki/Equifax#May–July_2017_data_breach","/wiki/Deloitte#2016–17_email_hack","/wiki/Disqus#October_2017_security_breach","/wiki/Anonymous_(group)","/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous","/wiki/Bureau_121","/wiki/Cozy_Bear","/wiki/CyberBerkut","/wiki/Derp_(hacker_group)","/wiki/Equation_Group","/wiki/Fancy_Bear","/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America","/wiki/Goatse_Security","/wiki/Guccifer_2.0","/wiki/Hacking_Team","/wiki/Iranian_Cyber_Army","/wiki/Lizard_Squad","/wiki/LulzRaft","/wiki/LulzSec","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack#Perpetrators","/wiki/NullCrew","/wiki/NSO_Group","/wiki/PayPal_14","/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398","/wiki/PLATINUM_(cybercrime_group)","/wiki/Pranknet","/wiki/RedHack","/wiki/Rocket_Kitten","/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers","/wiki/Syrian_Electronic_Army","/wiki/TeaMp0isoN","/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations","/wiki/UGNazi","/wiki/Yemen_Cyber_Army","/wiki/George_Hotz","/wiki/Guccifer","/wiki/Hector_Monsegur","/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond","/wiki/Junaid_Hussain","/wiki/Kristoffer_von_Hassel","/wiki/Mustafa_Al-Bassam","/wiki/MLT_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Ryan_Ackroyd","/wiki/Topiary_(hacktivist)","/wiki/The_Jester_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Weev","/wiki/Evercookie","/wiki/ISeeYou","/wiki/Heartbleed","/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)","/wiki/POODLE","/wiki/Rootpipe","/wiki/Row_hammer","/wiki/JASBUG","/wiki/Stagefright_(bug)","/wiki/DROWN_attack","/wiki/Badlock","/wiki/Dirty_COW","/wiki/Cloudbleed","/wiki/Broadcom#Vulnerabilities","/wiki/EternalBlue","/wiki/DoublePulsar","/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology#Silent_Bob_is_Silent","/wiki/KRACK","/wiki/ROCA_vulnerability","/wiki/BlueBorne_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Ransomware#Bad_Rabbit","/wiki/Careto_(malware)","/wiki/CryptoLocker","/wiki/Dexter_(malware)","/wiki/Duqu","/wiki/Duqu_2.0","/wiki/FinFisher","/wiki/Flame_(malware)","/wiki/Gameover_ZeuS","/wiki/Mahdi_(malware)","/wiki/Metulji_botnet","/wiki/Mirai_(malware)","/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog","/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club#Staatstrojaner_affair","/wiki/Shamoon","/wiki/Stars_virus","/wiki/Stuxnet","/wiki/Vault_7","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/X-Agent","/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center","/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center#Ransomware"}

The website was taken down with the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice\nsince the domain of the website was bought from a US-based web hosting company. The website itself was found to be hosted in Russia.[8]\n\n","","","Trend Micro\nconducted its own investigation on the extent of the data breach. It found that 1.3 million records of Overseas Filipino voters, which included passport numbers and expiry dates were included in the data dumps by the hackers. The security firm found the breach as \"alarming\" since it said that the data are easily accessible to the public were in plain text. It also added that 15.8 million record of fingerprints along with a list of people who have run for office since the 2010 elections were found by the firm's investigation.

It said that the results website that the election body is planning will be hosted in a different website with a different and better set of security measures.[9]\n\nIt further added that the database might be fake saying that no biometrics date were compromised by the hackers as opposed to Trend Micro's findings. COMELEC also noted that Trend Micro accessed the dumped data by hackers on its investigation and said that it has no capability of validating the data since it had no access to its original database.[10]\n\n","On April 12, COMELEC announced that the National Bureau of Investigation had a \"very good lead\" regarding the hackers behind the breach.

Biteng breached the server of the Comelec website, while De Asis downloaded the 340 gigabyte voter database five days before the website was defaced on March 27.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df610262df3aa1b2f589"},"content":{"contents":["The Democratic National Committee cyber attacks\ntook place in 2015 and 2016, in which computer hackers\ninfiltrated the Democratic National Committee\n(DNC) computer network\n, leading to a data breach\n. Some cybersecurity\nexperts, as well as the U.S. government, stated that the cyberespionage\nwas the work of Russian intelligence agencies.","Forensic evidence analyzed by several cybersecurity firms, CrowdStrike\n, Fidelis\n, and Mandiant\n(or FireEye\n), strongly indicates that two Russian\nintelligence agencies infiltrated the DNC computer systems. The American cybersecurity\nfirm CrowdStrike, which removed the hacking programs, revealed a history of encounters with both groups and had already named them, calling one of them Cozy Bear\nand the other Fancy Bear\n, names which are used in the media.[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n","On December 9, 2016, the CIA\ntold U.S. legislators the U.S. Intelligence Community\nconcluded Russia conducted the cyberattacks and other operations during the 2016 U.S. election\nto assist Donald Trump\nin winning the presidency.[6]\n\nMultiple U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that specific individuals tied to the Russian government provided WikiLeaks with the stolen emails from the DNC, as well as stolen emails from Hillary Clinton\n's campaign chairman, who was also the target of a cyberattack\n.[6]\n\nThese intelligence organizations additionally concluded Russia hacked the Republican National Committee\n(R.N.C.) as well as the D.N.C., but chose not to leak information obtained from the R.N.C.[7]\n\n","","","Cyber attacks that successfully penetrated the DNC computing system began in 2015. Attacks by \"Cozy Bear\" began in the summer of 2015. Attacks by \"Fancy Bear\" began in April 2016. It was after the \"Fancy Bear\" group began their activities that the compromised system became apparent. The groups were presumed to have been spying on communications, stealing opposition research\non Donald Trump\n, as well as reading all email\nand chats. Both were finally identified by CrowdStrike in May 2016. Both groups of intruders were successfully expelled from the DNC systems within hours after detection. These attacks are considered to be part of a group of recent attacks targeting U.S. government departments and several political organizations, including 2016 campaign organizations.[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n","On July 22, 2016, a person or entity going by the moniker \"Guccifer 2.0\n\" claimed on a WordPress\n-hosted blog to have been acting alone in hacking the DNC.[8]\n\n[9]\n\nHe also claimed to send significant amounts of stolen electronic DNC documents to WikiLeaks\n. WikiLeaks has not revealed the source for their leaked emails\n.[10]\n\nHowever, cybersecurity\nexperts and firms, including CrowdStrike\n, Fidelis Cybersecurity\n, Mandiant\n, SecureWorks\n, ThreatConnect\n, and the editor for Ars Technica\n, have rejected the claims of \"Guccifer 2.0\" and have determined, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the cyberattacks were committed by two Russian state-sponsored groups (Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear).[11]\n\n[12]\n\n[13]\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\n[16]\n\n[excessive citations\n\n\n]\n","According to separate reports in the New York Times\nand the Washington Post\n, U.S. intelligence agencies\nhave concluded with \"high confidence\"[17]\n\nthat the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the DNC.[17]\n\n[18]\n\nWhile the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia was behind the cyberattack, intelligence officials told the Washington Post\nthat they had \"not reached a conclusion about who passed the emails to WikiLeaks\" and so did not know \"whether Russian officials directed the leak.\"[18]\n\nA number of experts and cybersecurity analysts believe that \"Guccifer 2.0\" is probably a Russian government disinformation cover story to distract attention away from the DNC breach by the two Russian intelligence agencies.[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[19]\n\n","President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a discussion about computer security\nissues, which took place as a side segment during the then-ongoing G20 summit\nin China in September 2016. Obama said Russian hacking stopped after his warning to Putin.[20]\n\n","In a joint statement on October 7, 2016, the United States Department of Homeland Security\nand the Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated that the US intelligence community is confident that the Russian government directed the breaches and the release of the obtained or allegedly obtained material in an attempt to \"… interfere with the US election process.\"[21]\n\n[22]\n\n[23]\n\n","As is common among Russian intelligence services, both groups used similar hacking tools and strategies. It is believed that neither group was aware of the other. Although this is antithetical to American computer intelligence\nmethods, for fear of undermining or defeating intelligence operations\nof the other, this has been common practice in the Russian intelligence community since 2004.[2]\n\n[4]\n\n[24]\n\n","This intrusion was part of several attacks attempting to access information from American political organizations, including the 2016 U.S. presidential campaigns\n.[25]\n\nBoth \"Cozy Bear\" and \"Fancy Bear\" are known adversaries, who have extensively engaged in political and economic espionage that benefits the Russian Federation\ngovernment. Both are believed connected to the Russian intelligence services. Also, both access resources and demonstrate levels of proficiency matching nation-state capabilities.","\"Cozy Bear\" has in the past year infiltrated unclassified computer systems of the White House\n, the U.S. State Department\n, and the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff\n. According to CrowdStrike\n, other targeted sectors include:\nDefense, Energy, Mining\n, Financial, Insurance, Legal, Manufacturing, Media, Think tanks\n, Pharmaceutical, Research\nand Technology\nindustries as well as universities. \"Cozy Bear\" observed attacks have occurred in Western Europe\n, Brazil, China\n, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand\n, South Korea, Turkey\nand Central Asia\n.[2]\n\n[4]\n\n","\"Fancy Bear\" has been operating since the mid-2000s. CrowdStrike\nreported targeting has included Aerospace\n, Defense, Energy, Government and the Media industries. \"Fancy Bear\" intrusions have occurred in United States\n, Western Europe, Brazil, Canada\n, China, Republic of Georgia\n, Iran\n, Japan, Malaysia\nand South Korea\n. Targeted defense ministries\nand military organizations parallel Russian Federation government interests. This may indicate affiliation with the Main Intelligence Directorate\n(GRU, a Russian military intelligence service). Specifically, \"Fancy Bear\" has been linked to intrusions into the German Bundestag\nand France’s TV5 Monde\n(television station) in April 2015.[2]\n\n[4]\n\nSecureWorks\n, a cybersecurity firm headquartered in the United States, concluded that from March 2015 to May 2016, the \"Fancy Bear\" target list included not merely the DNC, but tens of thousands of foes of Putin and the Kremlin in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, and Syria. Only a handful of Republicans were targeted, however.[26]\n\n","\"Cozy Bear\" had access to DNC systems since the summer of 2015; and \"Fancy Bear\", since April 2016. There was no evidence of collaboration or knowledge of the other's presence within the system. Rather, the \"two Russian espionage groups compromised the same systems and engaged separately in the theft of identical credentials\".[4]\n\n[24]\n\n[27]\n\n\"Cozy Bear\" employed the \"Sea Daddy\" implant and a \"Power Shell\n\" backdoor launching malicious code\nenabled at various times and in various DNC systems. \"Fancy Bear\" employed X Agent\nmalware which enabled distant command execution\n, transmissions of files\nand keylogging\n, as well as the \"X-Tunnel\" malware.","DNC leaders became aware of the compromise in April 2016. These attacks broadly reflect Russian government interest in the U.S. political system, as well as political leaders' policies, tendencies and proclivities while assessing possible beneficial outcomes. The attacks also broadly reflect Russian government interest in the strategies, policies, and practices of the U.S. Government. This also globally reflects foreign governments' interest in ascertaining information on Donald Trump as a new entry into U.S. political leadership roles, in contrast to information likely to have been garnered over the decades pertaining to the Clintons.[2]\n\n[4]\n\n","The DNC commissioned the cybersecurity company, CrowdStrike\n, to defeat the intrusions. Its Chief Technology Officer\n, Dmitri Alperovitch\n, who is also a cybersecurity expert, stated:","CrowdStrike stands fully by its analysis and findings identifying two separate Russian intelligence-affiliated adversaries present in the DNC network in May 2016[...] We've had lots of experience with both of these actors attempting to target our customers in the past and know them well. In fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis. Their tradecraft\nis superb, operational security\nsecond to none and the extensive usage of 'living-off-the-land' techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter.[4]\n\n","Other cybersecurity firms, Fidelis Cybersecurity\nand FireEye\n, independently reviewed the malware and came to the same conclusion as CrowdStrike\n—that expert Russian hacking groups were responsible for the breach.[28]\n\nIn November 2017, US authorities identified 6 Russian individuals who conducted the hack.[29]\n\nBeginning in December 2016 the Russian government arrested Sergei Mikhailov\n, a high ranking government cyber-spy, Ruslan Stoyanov, a private sector cyber-security expert, Georgy Fomchenkov, a former government cyber-spy, and Dmitry Dokuchaev, a Mikhailov associate and charged them with aiding U.S. intelligence agencies which the New York Times associated with the DNC hacking.[30]\n\n[31]\n\n","Although the DNC claimed that no personal, financial, or donor information was accessed, \"Guccifer 2.0\" leaked what he or they claimed were donor lists detailing DNC campaign contributions to Gawker\nand The Smoking Gun\n.[32]\n\n[33]\n\nHowever, this information has not been authenticated, and doubts remain about Guccifer 2.0's backstory.[34]\n\n","In June 2016, a person or person(s) claimed to be the hacker who had hacked the DNC servers and then published the stolen documents online.[35]\n\n\"Guccifer 2.0\" later also claimed to have leaked 20.000 emails to Wikileaks\n.[36]\n\n[37]\n\n","The U.S. Intelligence Community\ntasked resources debating why Putin chose summer 2016 to escalate active measures influencing U.S. politics.[38]\n\nDirector of National Intelligence\nJames R. Clapper\nsaid after the 2011–13 Russian protests\nthat Putin's confidence in his viability as a politician was damaged, and Putin responded with the propaganda operation.[38]\n\nFormer CIA\nofficer Patrick Skinner explained the goal was to spread uncertainty.[39]\n\nU.S. Congressman Adam Schiff\n, Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence\n, commented on Putin's aims, and said U.S. intelligence agencies were concerned with Russian propaganda.[38]\n\nSpeaking about disinformation that appeared in Hungary\n, Slovakia\n, the Czech Republic\n, and Poland\n, Schiff said there was an increase of the same behavior in the U.S.[38]\n\nSchiff concluded Russian propaganda operations would continue against the U.S. after the election.[38]\n\n","On December 9, 2016, the CIA\ntold U.S. legislators the U.S. Intelligence Community\nconcluded Russia conducted operations during the 2016 U.S. election to assist Donald Trump in winning the presidency.[6]\n\n[40]\n\n[41]\n\nMultiple U.S intelligence agencies concluded people with specific individuals tied to the Russian government gave WikiLeaks\nhacked emails from the Democratic National Committee\n(D.N.C.) and additional sources such as John Podesta\n, campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton\n.[6]\n\nThese intelligence organizations additionally concluded Russia hacked the Republican National Committee\n(R.N.C.) as well as the D.N.C. — and chose not to leak information obtained from the R.N.C.[7]\n\nThe CIA said the foreign intelligence agents were Russian operatives previously known to the U.S.[6]\n\nCIA officials told U.S. Senators it was \"quite clear\" Russia's intentions were to help Trump.[40]\n\nTrump released a statement December 9, and disregarded the CIA conclusions.[6]\n\n","Members of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee\ntraveled to Ukraine and Poland in 2016 and learned about Russian operations to influence their affairs.[42]\n\nU.S. Senator Angus King\ntold the Portland Press Herald\n\nthat tactics used by Russia during the 2016 U.S. election were analogous to those used against other countries.[42]\n\nOn 30 November 2016, King joined a letter in which seven members of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee asked President Obama to publicize more information from the intelligence community on Russia's role in the U.S. election.[42]\n\n[43]\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Senator King warned against ignoring the problem, saying it was a bipartisan issue.[44]\n\n","Representatives in the U.S. Congress\ntook action to monitor the National security of the United States\nby advancing legislation to monitor propaganda.[45]\n\n[46]\n\nOn 30 November 2016, legislators approved a measure within the National Defense Authorization Act\nto ask the U.S. State Department\nto act against propaganda with an inter-agency panel.[45]\n\n[46]\n\nThe legislation authorized funding of $160 million over a two-year-period.[45]\n\nThe initiative was developed through a bipartisan\nbill, the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act\n, written by U.S. Senators Republican Rob Portman\nand Democrat Chris Murphy\n.[45]\n\nPortman urged more U.S. government action to counter propaganda.[45]\n\nMurphy said after the election it was apparent the U.S. needed additional tactics to fight Russian propaganda.[45]\n\nU.S. Senate Intelligence Committee\nmember Ron Wyden\nsaid frustration over covert Russian propaganda was bipartisan.[45]\n\n","Republican U.S. Senators stated they planned to hold hearings and investigate Russian influence on the 2016 U.S. elections.[47]\n\nBy doing so they went against the preference of incoming Republican President-elect Donald Trump, who downplayed any potential Russian meddling in the election.[47]\n\nU.S. Senate Armed Services Committee\nChairman John McCain\nand U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee\nChairman Richard Burr\ndiscussed plans for collaboration on investigations of Russian cyberwarfare\nduring the election.[47]\n\nU.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee\nChairman Bob Corker\nplanned a 2017 investigation.[47]\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham\nindicated he would conduct a sweeping investigation in the 115th Congress\n.[47]\n\n","On December 9, 2016, President Obama ordered the entire United States Intelligence Community\nto conduct an investigation into Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. election — and provide a report before he leaves office on January 20, 2017.[48]\n\n[49]\n\n[50]\n\nLisa Monaco\n, U.S. Homeland Security Advisor\nand chief counterterrorism advisor to the president, announced the study, and said the intrusion of a foreign nation into a U.S. national election was an unprecedented event that would necessitate further investigation by subsequent administrations in the executive branch.[48]\n\nThe intelligence analysis will take into account data from the last three presidential elections

The distributed denial-of-service\n(DDoS) attack was accomplished through a large number of DNS lookup requests from tens of millions of IP addresses.[5]\n\nThe activities are believed to have been executed through a botnet\nconsisting of a large number of Internet-connected devices\n—such as printers\n, IP cameras\n, residential gateways\nand baby monitors\n—that had been infected with the Mirai\nmalware.","","","According to Dyn, a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack began at 7:00\u0026#160;a.m. (EDT\n) and was resolved by 9:20\u0026#160;a.m. A second attack was reported at 11:52\u0026#160;a.m. and Internet users began reporting difficulties accessing websites.[6]\n\n[7]\n\nA third attack began in the afternoon, after 4:00\u0026#160;p.m.[5]\n\n[8]\n\nAt 6:11\u0026#160;p.m., Dyn reported that they had resolved the issue.[9]\n\n[10]\n\n","Dyn Chief Strategy Officer and spokesperson Kyle York\nled the communication response with customers, partners and the market.","Services affected by the attack included:","The US Department of Homeland Security\nstarted an investigation into the attacks, according to a White House\nsource.[2]\n\n[33]\n\n[34]\n\nNo group of hackers claimed responsibility during or in the immediate aftermath of the attack.[35]\n\nDyn's chief strategist said in an interview that the assaults on the company's servers were very complex and unlike everyday DDoS attacks.[7]\n\nBarbara Simons\n, a member of the advisory board of the United States Election Assistance Commission\n, said such attacks could affect electronic voting\nfor overseas military or civilians.[7]\n\n","Dyn disclosed that, according to business risk intelligence firm FlashPoint and Akamai Technologies\n, the attack was a botnet\ncoordinated through a large number of Internet of Things\n-enabled (IoT) devices, including cameras\n, residential gateways\n, and baby monitors\n, that had been infected with Mirai\nmalware. The attribution of the attack to the Mirai botnet had been previously reported by BackConnect Inc. another security firm.[36]\n\nDyn stated that they were receiving malicious requests from tens of millions of IP addresses\n.[5]\n\n[37]\n\nMirai is designed to brute-force\nthe security on an IoT device, allowing it to be controlled remotely.","Cybersecurity investigator Brian Krebs\nnoted that the source code for Mirai had been released onto the Internet in an open-source\nmanner some weeks prior, which will make the investigation of the perpetrator more difficult.[38]\n\nSince then, Mirai has been adapted in other malware projects.[39]\n\n","On 25 October 2016, US President Obama stated that the investigators still had no idea who carried out the cyberattack.[40]\n\n","On 13 December 2017, the Justice Department announced that three men (Paras Jha, 21, Josiah White, 20, and Dalton Norman, 21) had entered guilty pleas in cybercrime cases relating to the Mirai and clickfraud botnets.[41]\n\n","In correspondence with the website Politico\n, hacktivist\ngroups SpainSquad, Anonymous\n, and New World Hackers\nclaimed responsibility for the attack in retaliation for Ecuador\n's rescinding Internet access to WikiLeaks\nfounder Julian Assange\n, at their embassy in London\n, where he has been granted asylum\n.[4]\n\nThis claim has yet to be confirmed.[4]\n\nWikiLeaks alluded to the attack on Twitter\n, tweeting \"Mr. Assange is still alive and WikiLeaks is still publishing.

Hayden\nhas stated that Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election is the \"most successful covert influence operation in history.\"[400]\n\n","In July 2016, WikiLeaks\nfounder Julian Assange\nstated he had not seen evidence linking Russia to the emails leaked from the DNC.[401]\n\nIn November 2016, Assange said Russia was not the source of John Podesta's hacked emails published by Wikileaks.[402]\n\n","On December 10, 2016, ten electors\n, headed by Christine Pelosi\n, daughter of former United States Speaker of the House\nNancy Pelosi\n(D-CA), wrote an open letter\nto the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper\ndemanding an intelligence briefing on investigations into foreign intervention in the presidential election.[403]\n\n[404]\n\nFifty-eight additional electors subsequently added their names to the letter,[404]\n\nbringing the total to 68 electors from 17 different states.[405]\n\nThe Clinton campaign supported the call for a classified briefing for electors, with John Podesta\nsaying electors \"have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution.\"[406]\n\nOn December 16, 2016, the briefing request was denied.[407]\n\n","The Russian government initially issued categorical denials of any involvement in the U.S. presidential election.[36]\n\nAlready in June 2016, in a statement to Reuters\n, Kremlin\nspokesman Dmitry Peskov\ndenied any connection of Russian government bodies to the DNC hacks\nthat had been blamed on Russia.[8]\n\n[408]\n\nWhen a new intelligence report surfaced in December 2016, Sergey Lavrov\n, Foreign Minister of Russia\n, rejected the accusations again.[9]\n\n[29]\n\nWhen ABC News\nwrote that Russian President\nVladimir Putin\nwas directly involved in the covert operation,[30]\n\nPeskov called this report garbage.[409]\n\nOn December 16, 2016, Peskov called on the U.S. government to cease discussion of the topic unless they provide evidence to back up their assertions.[410]\n\nThe New Yorker\n\ncited an unnamed, pro-Kremlin Russian lawmaker who denied any Russian involvement, but then tried to justify any hypothetical Russian interference by accusing Washington of having engaged in long-term interference in Russian politics.[411]\n\n","At the Valdai International Discussion Club forum in October 2016, Vladimir Putin denounced American \"hysteria\" over alleged Russian interference.[10]\n\nDuring his December 23 press conference, Putin deflected questions on the issue by accusing the U.S. Democratic Party\nof scapegoating Russia after losing the presidential election. He also remarked that the Republicans\nwon control of the House\nand Senate\nin state elections\nand wondered if Russia was deemed responsible for this as well.[412]\n\n","In early 2017, it was reported that there was a purge of suspected traitors underway in Russia's intelligence apparatus\nthat mainly targeted computer security professionals, the arrested men being charged \"with treason\nin favor of the United States\"; experts speculated that those arrested might have provided the U.S. government with information that allowed the U.S. intelligence officials to accuse Russia of using hackers to try influence the 2016 presidential election.[413]\n\n[414]\n\n[125]\n\n","On June 1, 2017, Putin told journalists in St. Petersburg that \"patriotically minded\" Russian hackers could have been responsible for the cyberattacks against the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, while continuing to deny government involvement. Putin said that hackers \"are like artists\" stating: \"If they are patriotically minded, they start making their contributions — which are right, from their point of view — to the fight against those who say bad things about Russia. Putin continued to deny Russian government involving, stating, \"We're not doing this on the state level.\"[36]\n\nPutin's comments echoed similar remarks that he had made earlier the same week to the French newspaper Le Figaro\n\n.[36]\n\n","On September 19, 2017, at his Senate confirmation hearing, Jon Huntsman Jr.\n, Trump's nominee for United States Ambassador to Russia\n, stated: \"There is no question, underline no question, that the Russian government interfered in the U.S. election last year.\"[415]\n\n","On October 19, 2017, CIA Director Mike Pompeo\nspoke at an event hosted by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\n.

The statement was at odds with a report released in January by the Director of National Intelligence, which stated that the intelligence community did \"not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election\".","The next day, October 20, CIA agency spokesman Dean Boyd responded with a revision to Pompeo's remarks: \"The intelligence assessment

It propagated through EternalBlue\n, an exploit in older Windows systems released by The Shadow Brokers\na few months prior to the attack. While Microsoft\nhad released patches previously to close the exploit, much of WannaCry's spread was from organizations that had not applied these, or were using older Windows systems that were past their end-of-life\n. WannaCry also took advantage of installing backdoors\nonto infected systems.","The attack was stopped within a few days of its discovery due to emergency patches released by Microsoft, and the discovery of a kill switch\nthat prevented infected computers from spreading WannaCry further. The attack was estimated to have affected more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, with total damages ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars\n. Security experts believed from preliminary evaluation of the worm that the attack originated from North Korea or agencies working for the country.","In December 2017, the United States\n, United Kingdom\nand Australia\nformally asserted that North Korea\nwas behind the attack.[5]\n\n","","","WannaCry is a ransomware\ncryptoworm\n, which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows\noperating system\nby encrypting data and demanding ransom payments in the Bitcoin\ncryptocurrency\n.[a]\n\nIt is considered a network worm because it also includes a \"transport\" mechanism to automatically spread itself. This transport code scans for vulnerable systems, then uses the EternalBlue\nexploit to gain access, and the DoublePulsar\ntool to install and execute a copy of itself.[11]\n\n","EternalBlue is an exploit\nof Windows' Server Message Block\n(SMB) protocol released by The Shadow Brokers\n. Much of the attention and comment around the event was occasioned by the fact that the U.S. National Security Agency\n(NSA) had already discovered the vulnerability, but used it to create an exploit for its own offensive work\n, rather than report it to Microsoft.[12]\n\n[13]\n\nMicrosoft eventually discovered the vulnerability, and on Tuesday\n, March 14, 2017, they issued security bulletin MS17-010, which detailed the flaw and announced that patches\nhad been released for all Windows versions that were currently supported at that time, these being Windows 7\n, Windows 8.1\n, Windows 10\n, Windows Server 2008\n, Windows Server 2012\n, and Windows Server 2016\n, in addition to Windows Vista\n(which had recently ended support).[14]\n\n","DoublePulsar is a backdoor\ntool, also released by The Shadow Brokers on 14 April 2017. Starting from 21 April 2017, security researchers reported that computers with the DoublePulsar backdoor installed were in the tens of thousands.[15]\n\nBy 25 April, reports estimated the number of infected computers to be up to several hundred thousands, with numbers increasing exponentially every day.[16]\n\n[17]\n\nThe WannaCry code can take advantage of any existing DoublePulsar infection, or installs it itself.[11]\n\n[18]\n\n[19]\n\n","When executed, the WannaCry malware first checks the \"kill switch\n\" domain name;[b]\n\nif it is not found, then the ransomware encrypts\nthe computer's data,[20]\n\n[21]\n\n[22]\n\nthen attempts to exploit the SMB vulnerability to spread out to random computers on the Internet,[23]\n\nand \"laterally\" to computers on the same network.[24]\n\nAs with other modern ransomware, the payload\ndisplays a message informing the user that files have been encrypted, and demands a payment of around $300 in bitcoin\nwithin three days, or $600 within seven days.[21]\n\n[25]\n\nThree hardcoded\nbitcoin addresses, or \"wallets\", are used to receive the payments of victims. As with all such wallets, their transactions and balances are publicly accessible even though the cryptocurrency wallet\nowners remain unknown.[26]\n\n","Several organizations released detailed technical writeups of the malware, including Microsoft,[27]\n\nCisco\n,[11]\n\nMalwarebytes\n,[23]\n\nSymantec\nand McAfee\n.[24]\n\n","The attack began on Friday, 12 May 2017,[28]\n\n[29]\n\nwith evidence pointing to an initial infection in Asia at 7:44am UTC.[28]\n\n[30]\n\nThe initial infection was likely through an exposed vulnerable\nSMB port,[31]\n\nrather than email phishing as initially assumed.[28]\n\nWithin a day the code was reported to have infected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries.[32]\n\n[33]\n\n","Organizations that had not installed Microsoft's security update from April 2017 were affected by the attack.[34]\n\nThose still running unsupported\nversions of Microsoft Windows\n, such as Windows XP\nand Windows Server 2003\n[35]\n\n[36]\n\nwere at particularly high risk because no security patches had been released since April 2014 (with the exception of one emergency patch released in May 2014).[6]\n\nA Kaspersky Lab\nstudy reported that less than 0.1 percent of the affected computers were running Windows XP, and that 98 percent of the affected computers were running Windows 7.[6]\n\n[37]\n\nIn a controlled testing environment, the cybersecurity firm Kryptos Logic found that they were unable to infect a Windows XP system with WannaCry using just the exploits, as the payload failed to load, or caused the operating system to crash rather than actually execute and encrypt files. However, when executed manually, WannaCry could still operate on Windows XP.[38]\n\n[39]\n\n","Experts quickly advised affected users against paying the ransom due to no reports of people getting their data back after payment and as high revenues would encourage more of such campaigns.[40]\n\n[41]\n\n[42]\n\nAs of 14 June 2017, after the attack had subsided, a total of 327 payments totaling $130,634.77 (51.62396539 XBT) had been transferred.[43]\n\n","The day after the initial attack in May, Microsoft released emergency security patches for Windows 7\nand Windows 8.1\n, as well an out-of-band security updates for end of life products Windows XP\n, Windows Server 2003\nand Windows 8\n; these patches had been created in February of that year following a tip off about the vulnerability in January of that year.[44]\n\n[36]\n\nOrganizations were advised to patch Windows and plug the vulnerability in order to protect themselves from the cyber attack.[45]\n\nThe head of Microsoft’s Cyber Defense Operations Center, Adrienne Hall, said that “Due to the elevated risk for destructive cyber-attacks at this time, we made the decision to take this action because applying these updates provides further protection against potential attacks with characteristics similar to WannaCrypt [alternative name to WannaCry]”.[46]\n\n[47]\n\n","Researcher Marcus Hutchins\n[48]\n\n[49]\n\naccidentally discovered the kill switch domain hardcoded\nin the malware.[50]\n\n[51]\n\n[52]\n\nRegistering a domain name\nfor a DNS sinkhole\nstopped the attack spreading as a worm, because the ransomware only encrypted the computer's files if it was unable to connect to that domain, which all computers infected with WannaCry before the website's registration had been unable to do. While this did not help already infected systems, it severely slowed the spread of the initial infection and gave time for defensive measures to be deployed worldwide, particularly in North America and Asia, which had not been attacked to the same extent as elsewhere.[53]\n\n[54]\n\n[55]\n\n[56]\n\n[57]\n\nOn 15 May, a new version of WannaCry appeared with the third and last kill-switch, which was registered by Check Point threat intelligence analysts.[58]\n\nA few days later, new version of WannaCry were detected that lack the kill switch.[59]\n\n[60]\n\n[61]\n\n[62]\n\n","On 19 May, it was reported that hackers were trying to use a Mirai\nbotnet variant to effect a distributed attack\non WannaCry's kill-switch domain with the intention of knocking it offline.[63]\n\nOn 22 May, @MalwareTechBlog protected the domain by switching to a cached version of the site, capable of dealing with much higher traffic loads than the live site.[64]\n\n","Separately, researchers from University College London\nand Boston University\nreported that their PayBreak\nsystem could defeat WannaCry and several other families of ransomware.[65]\n\n[66]\n\n","It was discovered that Windows encryption APIs used by WannaCry may not completely clear the prime numbers\nused to generate the payload's private keys from the memory, making it possible to potentially retrieve the required key if they had not yet been overwritten or cleared from resident memory. This behaviour was used by a French researcher to develop a tool known as WannaKey, which automates this process on Windows XP systems.[67]\n\n[68]\n\n[69]\n\nThis approach was iterated upon by a second tool known as Wanakiwi, which was tested to work on Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 as well.[70]\n\n","Within four days of the initial outbreak, new infections had slowed to a trickle due to these responses.[71]\n\n","Linguistic analysis of the ransom notes indicated the authors were likely fluent in Chinese and proficient in English, as the versions of the notes in those languages were probably human-written while the rest seemed to be machine-translated\n.[72]\n\n[73]\n\n","Cybersecurity companies Kaspersky Lab\nand Symantec\nhave both said the code has some similarities with that previously used by the Lazarus Group\n[74]\n\n(believed to have carried out the cyberattack on Sony Pictures\nin 2014 and a Bangladesh bank heist\nin 2016—and linked to North Korea\n).[74]\n\nThis could also be either simple re-use of code by another group[75]\n\nor an attempt to shift blame—as in a cyber false flag\noperation;[74]\n\nbut a leaked internal NSA memo is alleged to have also linked the creation of the worm to North Korea.[76]\n\nThe President of Microsoft\nsaid he believed North Korea was the originator of the WannaCry attack,[77]\n\nand the UK's National Cyber Security Centre reached the same conclusion.[78]\n\n","On December 18, 2017, the United States Government\nformally announced that it publicly considers North Korea to be the main culprit behind the WannaCry attack.[79]\n\nPresident\nTrump\n's Homeland Security Adviser\n, Tom Bossert\n, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal\n\nabout this charge, saying \"We do not make this allegation lightly. It is based on evidence.\"[80]\n\nIn a press conference the following day, Bossert said that the evidence indicates that Kim Jong-un\nhad given the order to launch the malware attack.[81]\n\nBossert said that Canada, New Zealand and Japan agree with the United States' assessment of the evidence that links the attack to North Korea,[82]\n\nwhile the United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office\nsays it also stands behind the United States' assertion.[83]\n\n","North Korea, however, denied being responsible for the cyberattack.[84]\n\n[85]\n\n","The ransomware campaign was unprecedented in scale according to Europol\n,[32]\n\nwhich estimates that around 200,000 computers were infected across 150 countries. According to Kaspersky Lab\n, the four most affected countries were Russia\n, Ukraine\n, India\nand Taiwan\n.[87]\n\n","One of the largest agencies struck by the attack was the National Health Service\nhospitals in England and Scotland,[88]\n\n[89]\n\nand up to 70,000 devices\u0026#160;– including computers, MRI scanners\n, blood-storage refrigerators and theatre equipment\u0026#160;– may have been affected.[90]\n\nOn 12 May, some NHS services had to turn away non-critical emergencies, and some ambulances were diverted.[91]\n\n[92]\n\nIn 2016, thousands of computers in 42 separate NHS trusts\nin England were reported to be still running Windows XP.[35]\n\nNHS hospitals in Wales and Northern Ireland were unaffected by the attack.[93]\n\n[91]\n\n","Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK\nin Tyne and Wear\n, England, halted production after the ransomware infected some of their systems. Renault\nalso stopped production at several sites in an attempt to stop the spread of the ransomware.[94]\n\n[95]\n\nSpain's Telefónica\n, FedEx\nand Deutsche Bahn\nwere hit, along with many other countries and companies worldwide.[96]\n\n[97]\n\n[98]\n\n","The attack's impact is said to be relatively low compared to other potential attacks of the same type and could have been much worse had a security expert, who was independently researching the malware, not discovered that a kill-switch had been built in by its creators[99]\n\n[100]\n\nor if it had been specifically targeted on highly critical infrastructure\n, like nuclear power plants\n, dams or railway systems.[101]\n\n[102]\n\n","According to Cyber risk modeling firm Cyence, economic losses from the cyber attack could reach up to $4 billion, with other groups estimating the losses to be in the hundreds of millions.[103]\n\n","The following is an alphabetical list of organisations confirmed to have been affected:","A number of experts highlighted the NSA\n's non-disclosure of the underlying vulnerability, and their loss of control over the EternalBlue attack tool that exploited it. Edward Snowden\nsaid that if the NSA had \"privately disclosed\nthe flaw used to attack hospitals when they found it, not when they lost it, the attack may not have happened\".[145]\n\nBritish cybersecurity expert Graham Cluley\nalso sees \"some culpability on the part of the U.S. intelligence services\". According to him and others \"they could have done something ages ago to get this problem fixed, and they didn't do it\". He also said that despite obvious uses for such tools to spy on people of interest\n, they have a duty to protect their countries' citizens.[146]\n\nOthers have also commented that this attack shows that the practice of intelligence agencies to stockpile exploits for offensive purposes rather than disclosing them for defensive purposes may be problematic.[100]\n\nMicrosoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith wrote, \"Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles\nstolen.\"[147]\n\n[148]\n\n[149]\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\nplaced the responsibility of the attack on U.S. intelligence services, for having created EternalBlue.[135]\n\n","On 17 May, United States bipartisan lawmakers introduced the PATCH Act\n[150]\n\nthat aims to have exploits reviewed by an independent board to \"balance the need to disclose vulnerabilities with other national security interests while increasing transparency and accountability to maintain public trust in the process\".[151]\n\n","The United States Congress will also hold a hearing on the attack on June 15.[152]\n\nTwo subpanels of the House Science Committee will hear the testimonies from various individuals working in the government and non-governmental sector about how the US can improve its protection mechanisms for its systems against similar attacks in the future.[152]\n\n","A cybersecurity researcher, working in loose collaboration with UK's National Cyber Security Centre\n,[153]\n\n[154]\n\nresearched the malware and discovered a \"kill switch\".[49]\n\nLater globally dispersed security researchers collaborated online\nto develop\nopen source\ntools[155]\n\n[156]\n\nthat allow for decryption without payment under some circumstances.[157]\n\nSnowden states that when \"[NSA]-enabled ransomware eats the Internet, help comes from researchers, not spy agencies\" and asks why this is the case.[158]\n\n[159]\n\n[154]\n\n","Other experts also used the publicity around the attack as a chance to reiterate the value and importance of having good, regular and secure\nbackups\n, good cybersecurity\nincluding isolating critical systems, using appropriate software, and having the latest security patches installed.[160]\n\nAdam Segal\n, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations\n, stated that \"the patching and updating systems are broken, basically, in the private sector and in government agencies\".[100]\n\nIn addition, Segal said that governments' apparent inability to secure vulnerabilities \"opens a lot of questions about backdoors and access to encryption that the government argues it needs from the private sector for security\".[100]\n\nArne Schönbohm\n, President of Germany's Federal Office for Information Security\n(BSI), stated that \"the current attacks show how vulnerable our digital society\nis. It's a wake-up call for companies to finally take IT security [seriously]\".[161]\n\n","The effects of the attack also had political implications; in the United Kingdom\n, the impact on the National Health Service\nquickly became political, with claims that the effects were exacerbated by Government underfunding of the NHS; in particular, the NHS ceased its paid Custom Support arrangement to continue receiving support for unsupported Microsoft software used within the organization, including Windows XP.[162]\n\nHome Secretary\nAmber Rudd\nrefused to say whether patient data had been backed up\n, and Shadow Health Secretary\nJon Ashworth\naccused Health Secretary\nJeremy Hunt\nof refusing to act on a critical note from Microsoft, the National Cyber Security Centre\n(NCSC) and the National Crime Agency\nthat had been received two months previously.[163]\n\nOthers argued that hardware and software vendors often fail to account for future security flaws, selling systems that − due to their technical design and market incentives − eventually won't be able to properly receive and apply patches.[164]\n\nThe NHS denied that it was still using XP, claiming only 4.7% of devices within the organization ran Windows XP.[165]\n\n[38]\n\n"],"title":"WannaCry ransomware

Mischa is a more conventional ransomware payload that encrypts user documents, as well as executable files, and does not require administrative privileges to execute.[2]\n\nThe earlier versions of Petya disguised its payload as a PDF\nfile, attached to an e-mail.[2]\n\nUnited States Computer Emergency Response Team (US-CERT) and National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) released Malware Initial Findings Report (MIFR) about Petya on 30th June 2017.[20]\n\n","The \"NotPetya\" variant utilized in the 2017 attack uses EternalBlue\n, an exploit\nwhich takes advantage of a vulnerability\nin Windows' Server Message Block\n(SMB) protocol. EternalBlue is generally believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency\n(NSA);[19]\n\nit was leaked in April 2017 and was also used by WannaCry\n.[21]\n\n[19]\n\nThe malware uses multiple techniques to spread\nto other computers on the same network, including harvesting passwords, and using those passwords in conjunction with PSExec to run code on other local computers.[22]\n\n[23]\n\n[24]\n\nAdditionally, although it still purports to be ransomware, the encryption routine was modified so that the malware could not technically revert its changes.[25]\n\nThis characteristic, along with other unusual signs in comparison to WannaCry (including the relatively low unlock fee of US$300, and using a single, fixed Bitcoin wallet to collect ransom payments rather than generating a unique ID for each specific infection for tracking purposes),[26]\n\nprompted researchers to speculate that this attack was not intended to be a profit-generating venture, but to damage devices quickly, and ride off\nthe media attention WannaCry received by claiming to be ransomware.[27]\n\n[28]\n\n","It was found that it may be possible to stop the encryption process if an infected computer is immediately shut down when the fictitious chkdsk screen appears,[29]\n\nand a security analyst proposed that creating read-only\nfiles named perf.c\nand/or perfc.dat\nin the Windows installation directory could prevent the payload of the current strain from executing.[30]\n\n[31]\n\n[32]\n\n[33]\n\nThe email address listed on the ransom screen was suspended by its provider, Posteo\n, for being a violation of its terms of use\n. As a result, infected users could not actually send the required payment confirmation to the perpetrator.[26]\n\n[34]\n\n","Microsoft had already released patches for supported versions of Windows\nin March 2017 to address the EternalBlue vulnerability. This was followed by patches for unsupported versions of Windows (such as Windows XP\n) in May 2017, in the direct wake of WannaCry.[35]\n\n[36]\n\nWired\nbelieved that \"based on the extent of damage Petya has caused so far, though, it appears that many companies have put off patching, despite the clear and potentially devastating threat of a similar ransomware spread.\"[37]\n\nSome enterprises may consider it too disruptive to install updates on certain systems, either due to possible downtime or compatibility concerns, which can be problematic in some environments.[35]\n\n","During the attack initiated on 27 June 2017, the radiation monitoring system at Ukraine's Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant\nwent offline.[38]\n\nSeveral Ukrainian ministries, banks and metro systems were also affected.[39]\n\nIt is said to be the most destructive cyberattack ever.[40]\n\n","Among those affected elsewhere included British advertising company WPP\n,[39]\n\nMaersk\nLine,[41]\n\nAmerican pharmaceutical company Merck \u0026amp; Co.\n, Russian oil company Rosneft\n(its oil production was unaffected[42]\n\n), multinational law firm DLA Piper\n,[39]\n\nFrench construction company Saint-Gobain\nand its retail and subsidiary outlets in Estonia,[43]\n\nBritish consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser\n,[44]\n\nGerman personal care company Beiersdorf\n, German logistics company DHL\n,[45]\n\nUnited States food company Mondelez\n, and American hospital operator Heritage Valley Health System.[4]\n\n[46]\n\nThe actory,_Tasmania\" title=\"Cadbury's Chocolate Factory, Tasmania\"\u003eCadbury's Chocolate Factory\nin Hobart\n, Tasmania, is the first company in Australia to be affected by Petya.[47]\n\nOn 28 June 2017, JNPT\n, India's largest container port, had reportedly been affected, with all operations coming to a standstill.[48]\n\nPrinceton Community Hospital in rural West Virginia will scrap and replace its entire computer network on its path to recovery.[49]\n\n","The business interruption to the Maersk\n, the world's largest container ship and supply vessel operator, was estimated between $200 and $300m in lost revenues.[50]\n\n","Jens Stoltenberg\n, NATO\nSecretary-General, pressed the alliance to strengthen its cyber defenses, saying that a cyberattack could trigger the Article 5 principle of collective defense.[51]\n\n[52]\n\n","Europol\nsaid it was aware and is urgently responding to reports of a cyber attack in member states of the European Union\n.[5]\n\nIn the United States, the Department of Homeland Security\nis involved and coordinating with its international and local partners.[41]\n\nIn a letter to the NSA,[53]\n\nDemocratic Congressman Ted Lieu\nasks the agency to collaborate more actively with technology companies to notify them of software vulnerabilities and help them prevent future attacks based on malware created by the NSA.[24]\n\n[54]\n\nOn 15 February 2018, the Trump administration has blamed Russia for the attack and warned that there would be \"international consequences\"[55]\n\n, the United Kingdom and the Australian government also issued similar

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df7d0262df3aa1b2f590"},"content":{"contents":["\n\u0026#160;\nUkraine\n[1]\n\n","A series of powerful cyberattacks\nusing the Petya\nmalware began on 27 June 2017 that swamped websites of Ukrainian\norganizations, including banks, ministries, newspapers and electricity firms.[10]\n\nSimilar infections were reported in France\n, Germany\n, Italy\n, Poland\n, Russia\n, United Kingdom\n, the United States\nand Australia\n.[11]\n\n[3]\n\n[12]\n\nESET\nestimated on 28 June 2017 that 80% of all infections were in Ukraine, with Germany second hardest hit with about 9%.[2]\n\nOn 28 June 2017, the Ukrainian government\nstated that the attack was halted.[13]\n\nOn 30 June 2017, the Associated Press\nreported experts agreed that Petya was masquerading as ransomware\n, while it was actually designed to cause maximum damage, with Ukraine being the main target.[14]\n\n","","","Security experts believe the attack originated from an update of a Ukrainian tax accounting package called MeDoc (M.E.Doc\n\u0026#160;(uk\n)\n), developed by Intellect Service.[2]\n\nMeDoc is widely used among tax accountants in Ukraine,[15]\n\nand the software was the main option for accounting for other Ukrainian businesses, according to Mikko Hyppönen\n, a security expert at F-Secure\n.[2]\n\nMeDoc had about 400,000 customers across Ukraine, representing about 90% of the country's domestic firms[8]\n\nand prior to the attack was installed on an estimated 1 million computers in Ukraine.[16]\n\n","MeDoc provides periodic updates to its program through an update server. On the day of the attack, 27 June 2017, an update for MeDoc was pushed out by the update server, following which the ransomware attack began to appear. British malware expert Marcus Hutchins\nclaimed \"It looks like the software's automatic update system was compromised and used to download and run malware rather than updates for the software.\"[2]\n\nThe company that produces MeDoc claimed they had no intentional involvement in the ransomware attack, as their computer offices were also affected, and they are cooperating with law enforcement to track down the origin.[17]\n\n[15]\n\nSimilar attack via MeDoc software was carried out on 18 May 2017 with a ransomware XData. Hundreds of accounting departments were affected in Ukraine.[18]\n\n","The cyberattack was based on a modified version of the Petya\nransomware\n. Like the WannaCry ransomware attack\nin May 2017, Petya uses the EternalBlue\nexploit previously discovered in older versions of the Microsoft Windows\noperating system. When Petya is executed, it encrypts the Master File Table\nof the hard drive and forces the computer to restart. It then displays a message to the user, telling them their files are now encrypted and to send US$300 in bitcoin\nto one of three wallets to receive instructions to decrypt their computer. At the same time, the software exploits the Server Message Block\nprotocol in Windows to infect local computers on the same network, and any remote computers it can find.","The EternalBlue exploit had been previously identified, and Microsoft issued patches in March 2017 to shut down the exploit for the latest versions of Windows Vista\n, Windows 7\n, Windows 8.1\n, Windows 10\n, Windows Server 2008\n, Windows Server 2012\n, and Windows Server 2016\n. However, the WannaCry attack progressed through many computer systems that still used older Windows operating systems or previous releases of the newer ones, which still had the exploit, or that users had not taken the steps to download the patches. Microsoft issued new patches for Windows XP\nand Windows Server 2003\nas well as previous versions of the other operating systems the day after the WannaCry attack. Security expert Lesley Carhart stated that \"Every method of exploitation that the attack used to spread was preventable by well-documented means\".[19]\n\n","Security experts found that the version of Petya used in the Ukraine cyberattacks had been modified, and subsequently has been named NotPetya or Nyetna to distinguish it from the original malware. NotPetya encrypted all of the files on the infected computers, not just the Master File Table, and in some cases the computer's files were completely wiped or rewritten in a manner that could not be undone through decryption.[20]\n\n[21]\n\nSome security experts saw that the software could intercept passwords and perform administrator-level actions that could further ruin computer files. They also noted that the software could identify specific computer systems and bypass infection of those systems, suggesting the attack was more surgical in its goal.[19]\n\nThere also has yet to be discovery of a \"kill switch\n\" as there was with the WannaCry software, which would immediately stop its spread.[22]\n\nAccording to Nicholas Weaver of the University of California\nthe hackers had previously compromised MeDoc \"made it into a remote-control Trojan, and then they were willing to burn this asset to launch this attack.[8]\n\n","During the attack the radiation monitoring system at Ukraine's Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant\nwent offline.[23]\n\nSeveral Ukrainian ministries, banks, metro systems and state-owned enterprises (Boryspil International Airport\n, Ukrtelecom\n, Ukrposhta\n, State Savings Bank of Ukraine\n, Ukrainian Railways\n) were affected.[24]\n\nIn the infected computers, important computer files were overwritten and thus permanently damaged, despite the malware's displayed message to the user indicating that all files could be recovered \"safely and easily\" by meeting the attackers' demands and making the requested payment in Bitcoin\ncurrency.[25]\n\n","The attack has been seen to be more likely aimed at crippling the Ukrainian state rather than for monetary reasons.[15]\n\nThe attack came on the eve of the Ukrainian public holiday\n, Constitution Day\n(celebrating the anniversary of the approval by the Verkhovna Rada\n(Ukraine's parliament) of the Constitution of Ukraine\non 28 June 1996).[26]\n\n[27]\n\n[28]\n\nMost government offices would be empty, allowing the cyberattack to spread without interference.[15]\n\nIn addition, some security experts saw the ransomware engage in wiping the affected hard drives rather than encrypting them, which would be a further disaster for companies affected by this.[15]\n\n","A short time before the cyberattack began, it was reported that an intelligence officer and head of a special forces unit, Maksym Shapoval\n, was assassinated in Kiev\nby a car bomb.[29]\n\nFormer government adviser in Georgia\nand Moldova\nMolly K. McKew\nbelieved this assassination was related to the cyberattack.[30]\n\n","On 28 June 2017 the Ukrainian government\nstated that the attack was halted, \"The situation is under complete control of the cyber security specialists, they are now working to restore the lost data.\"[13]\n\n","Following the initial 27 June attack, security experts found that the code that had infected the M.E.Doc update had a backdoor\nthat could potentially be used to launch another cyberattack. On seeing signs of another cyberattack, the Ukrainian police raided the offices of MeDoc on 4 July 2017 and seized their servers. MeDoc's CEO stated that they were now aware there had been a backdoor installed on their servers, again refuted their involvement in the attack, and were working to help authorities identify the source.[16]\n\n[31]\n\nSecurity company ESET\nfound that the backdoor had been installed on MeDoc's updater service as early as 15 May 2017, while experts from Cisco Systems\n' Talos group found evidence of the backdoor as early as April 2017; either situation points to the cyberattack as a \"thoroughly well-planned and well-executed operation\".[32]\n\nUkrainian officials have stated that Intellect Service will \"face criminal responsibility\", as they had previously warned the company about lax security on their servers from anti-virus firms prior to these events but did not take steps to prevent it.[33]\n\nTalos warned that due to the large size of the MeDoc update that contained the NotPetya malware (1.5 gigabytes), there may be other backdoors that they have yet to find, and another attack could be possible.[32]\n\n","On 30 June, the Security Service of Ukraine\n(SBU) reported it had seized the equipment that had been used to launch the cyberattack, claiming it to have belonged to Russian agents responsible for launching the attack.[34]\n\nOn 1 July 2017 the SBU claimed that available data showed that the same perpetrators who in Ukraine in December 2016 attacked the financial system, transport and energy facilities of Ukraine (using TeleBots and BlackEnergy\n)[35]\n\nwere the same hacking groups who attacked Ukraine on 27 June 2017. \"This testifies to the involvement of the special services of Russian Federation in this attack,\" it concluded.[7]\n\n[36]\n\n(A December 2016 cyber attack on a Ukrainian state energy computer caused a power cut in the northern part of the capital, Kiev).[7]\n\nRussia–Ukraine relations\nare at a frozen state since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea\nfollowed by a Russian government-backed separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine\nthat by late June 2017 had killed more than 10,000 people.[7]\n\n(Russia has repeatedly denied sending troops or military equipment to eastern Ukraine\n).[7]\n\nUkraine claims that hacking Ukrainian state institutions is part of what they describe as a \"hybrid war\n\" by Russia on Ukraine.[7]\n\n","On 30 June 2017, cyber security firm ESET\nclaimed that the Telebots group (which they claimed had links to BlackEnergy) was behind the attack: \"Prior to the outbreak, the Telebots group targeted mainly the financial sector. The latest outbreak was directed against businesses in Ukraine, but they apparently underestimated the malware's spreading capabilities. That's why the malware went out of control.\"[7]\n\nESET had earlier reported that BlackEnergy had been targeting Ukrainian cyber infrastructure since 2014.[37]\n\nIn December 2016, ESET had concluded that TeleBots had evolved from the BlackEnergy hackers and that TeleBots had been using cyberattacks to sabotage the Ukrainian financial sector during the second half of 2016.[38]\n\n","Around the time of 4 July raid on MeDoc, the $10,000 in bitcoin already collected in the listed wallets for NotPetya had been collected, and experts believed it was used to buy space on the anonymous Tor\nnetwork. One message posted there purportedly from the NotPetya authors demanded 100,000 bitcoin (about $2.6 million) to halt the attack and decrypt all affected files.[16]\n\nOn 5 July 2017, a second message purportedly from the NotPetya authors was posted in a Tor\nwebsite, demanding those that wish to decrypt their files send 100 bitcoin (approximately $250,000). The message was signed with the same private key\nused by the original Petya ransomware, suggesting the same group was responsible for both.[39]\n\n","According to reports cited in January 2018 the United States Central Intelligence Agency\nclaimed Russia was behind the cyberattack, with Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate\n(GRU) having designed NotPetya.[40]\n\nSimilarly, the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence\naccused Russia in February 2018 of launching the cyberattack, that by attacking systems in the Ukraine, the cyberattack would spread and affect major systems in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Russia had denied its involvement, pointing out that Russian systems were also impacted by the attack.[41]\n\n","Companies affected include Antonov\n, Kyivstar\n, Vodafone Ukraine\n, lifecell\n, TV channels STB\n, ICTV\nand ATR\n, Kiev Metro\n, UkrGasVydobuvannya (UGV)\n, gas stations WOG\n, DTEK\n, EpiCentre K\n, Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany)\n, Prominvestbank\n, Ukrsotsbank\n, KredoBank\n, Oshchadbank\nand others,[13]\n\nwith over 1,500 legal entities and individuals having contacted the National Police of Ukraine\nto indicate that they had been victimized by 27 June 2017 cyberattack.[42]\n\nOshchadbank was again fully functional on 3 July 2017.[43]\n\nUkraine's electricity company\n's computers also went offline due to the attack; but the company continued to fully operate without using computers.[8]\n\n","While more than 80% of affected companies were from Ukraine,[needs update\n\n\n]\nthe ransomware also spread to several companies in other geolocations, due to those businesses having offices in Ukraine and networking around the globe. Non-Ukrainian companies reporting incidents related to the attack include food processor Mondelez International\n,[44]\n\nthe APM Terminals\nsubsidiary of international shipping company A.P. Moller-Maersk\n, the FedEx\nshipping subsidiary TNT Express\n(in August 2017 its deliveries were still disrupted due to the attack),[45]\n\nChinese shipping company COFCO Group\n, French construction materials company Saint Gobain\n,[46]\n\nadvertising agency WPP plc\n,[47]\n\nHeritage Valley Health System of Pittsburgh\n,[48]\n\nlaw firm DLA Piper\n,[49]\n\npharmaceutical company Merck \u0026amp; Co.\n,[50]\n\nconsumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser\n, and software provider Nuance Communications\n.[51]\n\nA Ukrainian police officer believes that the ransomware attack was designed to go global so as to distract from the directed cyberattack on Ukraine.[52]\n\n","The cost of the cyberattack had yet to be determined, as, after a week of its initial attack, companies were still working to mitigate the damage. Reckitt Benckiser lowered its sales estimates by 2% (about $130 million) for the second quarter primarily due to the attack that affected its global supply chain.[53]\n\n[51]\n\n","Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine\nOleksandr Turchynov\nclaimed there were signs of Russian involvement in the 27 June cyberattack, although he did not give any direct evidence.[54]\n\nRussian officials have denied any involvement, calling Ukraine's claims \"unfounded blanket accusations\".[34]\n\n","NATO\nSecretary-General Jens Stoltenberg\nvowed on 28 June 2017

{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df810262df3aa1b2f591"},"content":{"contents":["Equifax Inc.\nis a consumer credit reporting agency\n. Equifax collects and aggregates information on over 800 million individual consumers and more than 88 million businesses worldwide. Founded in 1899 and based in Atlanta\n, Georgia\n, it is one of the three largest credit agencies along with Experian\nand TransUnion\n(known as the “Big Three”).[4]\n\nEquifax has US$3.1 billion in annual revenue and 9,000+[3]\n\nemployees in 14 countries. It is listed on the NYSE\nas EFX.","Aside from offering credit and demographic related data and services to business,[5]\n\nEquifax sells credit monitoring and fraud-prevention services directly to consumers.[6]\n\nLike all credit reporting agencies, the company is required by US law to provide consumers with one free credit report every year.[7]\n\n","Equifax was the subject of more than 57,000 consumer complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\nfrom October 2012 to September 17, 2017 with most complaints relating to incomplete, inaccurate, outdated, or misattributed information held by the company.[8]\n\n","In September 2017, Equifax announced a cyber-security breach\n, which it claims to have occurred between mid-May and July 2017,[9]\n\nwhere cybercriminals accessed approximately 145.5 million U.S. Equifax consumers' personal data, including their full names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and, in some cases, driver license numbers. Equifax also confirmed at least 209,000 consumers' credit card credentials were taken in the attack. The company claims to have discovered evidence of the cybercrime event on July 29, 2017. Residents in the United Kingdom\nand Canada\nwere also impacted.","","","Equifax was founded in Atlanta, GA, as Retail Credit Company in 1899. The company grew quickly and by 1920 had offices throughout the US and Canada. By the 1960s, Retail Credit Company was one of the nation's largest credit bureaus, holding files on millions of American and Canadian citizens. Even though the company continued to do credit reporting, the majority of their business was making reports to insurance companies when people applied for new insurance policies including life, auto, fire and medical insurance. All of the major insurance companies used RCC to get information on health, habits, morals, use of vehicles and finances. They also investigated insurance claims and made employment reports when people were seeking new jobs. Most of the credit work was then being done by a subsidiary, Retailers Commercial Agency.","Retail Credit Company's extensive information holdings, and its willingness to sell them to anyone, attracted criticism of the company in the 1960s and 1970s. These included that it collected \"...facts, statistics, inaccuracies and rumors… about virtually every phase of a person's life; his marital troubles, jobs, school history, childhood, sex life, and political activities.\" The company was also alleged to reward its employees for collecting negative information on consumers.[10]\n\n","As a result, when the company moved to computerize its records, which would lead to much wider availability of the personal information it held, the US Congress held hearings in 1970. These led to the enactment of the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nin the same year which gave consumers rights regarding information stored about them in corporate databanks. It is alleged that the hearings prompted the Retail Credit Company to change its name to Equifax in 1975 to improve its image.[10]\n\n","The company later expanded into commercial credit reports on companies in the US, Canada and the UK, where it came into competition with companies such as Dun \u0026amp; Bradstreet\nand Experian\n. The insurance reporting was phased out. The company also had a division selling specialist credit information to the insurance industry but spun off this service, including the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE) database as ChoicePoint\nin 1997. The company formerly offered digital certification services, which it sold to GeoTrust\nin September 2001. In the same year, Equifax spun off its payment services division, forming the publicly listed company Certegy\n, which subsequently acquired Fidelity National Information Services\nin 2006. Certegy effectively became a subsidiary of Fidelity National Financial\nas a result of this reverse acquisition merger (See Certegy\nand Fidelity National Information Services\nfor further information)\n.","In October 2010, Equifax acquired Anakam, an identity verification software company.[11]\n\n","Equifax purchased eThority\n, a business intelligence\n(BI) company headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina\nin October 2011. eThority is partnering with TALX\n, a St. Louis-based business unit of Equifax, and will remain in Charleston.[12]\n\n","Equifax Workforce Solutions is one of the 55 contractors hired by the United States Department of Health and Human Services\nto work on the HealthCare.gov\nweb site.[13]\n\n","For most of its existence, Equifax has operated primarily in the business-to-business sector, selling consumer credit and insurance reports and related analytics to businesses in a range of industries.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nBusiness customers include retailers\n, insurance\nfirms, healthcare providers, utilities, government agencies, as well as banks\n, credit unions, personal and specialty finance companies and other financial institutions. Equifax sells businesses credit reports, analytics, demographic\ndata, and software. Credit reports provide detailed information on the personal credit and payment history of individuals, indicating how they have honored financial obligations such as paying bills or repaying a loan\n. Credit grantors use this information to decide what sort of products or services to offer their customers, and on what terms. Equifax also provides commercial credit reports, similar to Dun \u0026amp; Bradstreet, containing financial and non financial data on businesses of all sizes. Equifax collects and provides data through the NCTUE, an exchange of non credit data including consumer payment history on telco and utility accounts.","In 1999, Equifax began offering services to the credit consumer sector in addition, such as credit fraud and identity theft prevention products. Equifax, and other credit monitoring agencies are required by law to provide US residents with one free credit file disclosure every 12 months; the Annualcreditreport.com\nwebsite incorporates data from US Equifax credit records.","Equifax also offers fraud prevention products based on device fingerprinting\nsuch as \"FraudIQ Authenticate Device\".[14]\n\n","According to an October 2017 report from Motherboard\n, around December 2016, a security researcher examining Equifax's servers observed an online portal, apparently created for Equifax employees only, was accessible to the open Internet.","\"I didn't have to do anything fancy,\" the researcher told Motherboard, explaining that the site was vulnerable to a basic \"forced browsing\" bug. The researcher requested anonymity out of professional concerns. \"\"All you had to do was put in a search term and get millions of results, just instantly—in cleartext, through a web app,\" they said. In total, the researcher downloaded the data of hundreds of thousands of Americans in order to show Equifax the vulnerabilities within its systems. They said they could have downloaded the data of all of Equifax's customers in 10 minutes: \"I've seen a lot of bad things, but not this bad.\"","The same types of sensitive private information of American consumers (names, birth dates, social security numbers, etc.) were exposed as in the May–July breach, according to Motherboard. Additionally, the security researchers said they were able to gain shell\naccess on Equifax's servers and discovered and reported to Equifax additional vulnerabilities. According to the reporting, despite receiving this warning from the security researcher, the affected portal was not closed until six months later in June, well after the March and May–July breaches had begun.[15]\n\nMoreover, the employee portal was reportedly not the same server targeted in the later breaches, which Motherboard speculates may suggest multiple breaches by more than one party may have occurred.","On September 18, 2017, Bloomberg News\nreported that Equifax had been the victim of a \"major breach of its computer systems\" in March 2017, and that in early March it had begun \"notifying a small number of outsiders and banking customers\" about this attack.[16]\n\n","According to Bloomberg's report, a person familiar with the breach believed this early-March intrusion may have been carried out by the same party who breached Equifax's computer systems again in May. According to Bloomberg, Equifax enlisted Mandiant\n(owned by FireEye, Inc.\n) to assist in investigating the March attack. The same cybersecurity firm was hired following the May–July breach.[16]\n\n","On September 7, 2017, Equifax announced a cybercrime identity theft event potentially impacting approximately 145.5 million U.S. consumers.[18]\n\nInformation on an estimated range of under 400,000 up to 44 million British residents as well as 8,000 Canadian residents were also compromised.[19]\n\n[20]\n\n[21]\n\n[22]\n\n[23]\n\nVentureBeat\n\ncalled the exposure of data on 140 million customers \"one of the biggest data breaches in history.\"[24]\n\n","Though the attack was stated to have begun in mid-May, the breach was not observed until July 29, according to Equifax CEO Rick Smith and a subsequent report by Equifax.[9]\n\n[18]\n\n[25]\n\nInformation accessed by the hacker (or hackers) in the breach included first and last names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers. Credit card numbers for approximately 209,000 U.S. consumers, and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers were also accessed.[26]\n\n[25]\n\n","Equifax stated in a September 15 statement that it hired the services of Mandiant\non August 2 to internally investigate the intrusion. The statement did not however record in its timeline exactly when government authorities (\"all U.S. State Attorneys General\" and \"other federal regulators\") were notified of the breach, although it did assert \"the company continues to work closely with the FBI in its investigation.\"[25]\n\n","Equifax shares dropped 13 percent in early trading the day after the breach was made public.[27]\n\n","Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Equifax as a result of the breach.[28]\n\n[29]\n\nIn one suit the law firm Geragos \u0026amp; Geragos has indicated they would seek up to $70 billion in damages, which would make it the largest class-action suit in U.S. history.[28]\n\n","Numerous media outlets advised consumers to request a credit freeze\nto reduce the impact of the breach.[30]\n\n[31]\n\n[32]\n\n[33]\n\n","Equifax said the breach was facilitated using a flaw in Apache Struts\n(CVE-2017-5638).[34]\n\nA patch\nfor the vulnerability was released March 7, yet the company failed to apply the security updates before the attack occurred 2 months later.[35]\n\n[36]\n\nHowever, this was not the only point of failure: contributing factors included the insecure network design which lacked sufficient segmentation,[37]\n\npotentially inadequate encryption\nof personally identifiable information (PII),[38]\n\nand ineffective breach detection mechanisms\n.[39]\n\n","On September 15, Equifax issued a press release with bullet-point details of the intrusion, its potential consequences for consumers, and the company's response. The statement further commented on issues related to criticism regarding its initial response to the incident. The company also announced the immediate departures and replacements of its Chief Information Officer and Chief Security Officer.[25]\n\n[40]\n\n","Three days after Equifax revealed the May–July 2017 breach, Congressman Barry Loudermilk\n(R-GA), who had been given thousands of dollars by Equifax,[41]\n\n[42]\n\nintroduced a bill to the US House\nthat would reduce consumer protections in relation to the nation’s credit bureaus, including capping potential damages in a class action\nsuit to $500,000 regardless of class size or amount of loss.[43]\n\nThe bill would also eliminate all punitive damages\n.[43]\n\n[44]\n\nFollowing criticism by consumer advocates, Loudermilk agreed to delay consideration of the bill \"pending a full and complete investigation into the Equifax breach.\"[43]\n\n","On September 28, 2017, new Equifax CEO Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. responded to criticism of Equifax by promising that the company would, from early 2018, allow \"all consumers the option of controlling access to their personal credit data,\" and that this service would be \"offered free, for life.\"[45]\n\n","On October 2, 2017, Equifax revealed that the estimated number of affected Americans was 2.5 million more than previously reported. This brought the total number of potentially impacted Americans to 145.5 million.[46]\n\n","On October 10, 2017, Equifax stated that 15.2m UK customers had their records compromised in the breach,[47]\n\n[48]\n\nof which 693,665 had sensitive personal data\ndisclosed.[49]\n\n[50]\n\n[47]\n\n[51]\n\n[48]\n\n","Also around October 10, 2017, the number of drivers' licenses breached in the attack was reported to be 10-11million.[52]\n\n[53]\n\n[54]\n\n","In September, 2017, Richard Cordray\n, then director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n(CFPB), authorized an investigation into the data breach on behalf of affected consumers. However, in November, 2017, Mick Mulvaney\n, President Donald Trump’s budget chief, who was appointed by Trump to replace Cordray, was reported by Reuters to have “pulled back” on the probe, along with shelving Cordray’s plans for on-the-ground tests of how Equifax protects data. The CFPB also rebuffed bank regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank\n, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nand Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\nwho offered to assist with on-site exams of credit bureaus.[55]\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren\n, who released a report February 7, 2018 on the Equifax breech, was critical of Mulvaney’s actions, saying ““We’re unveiling this report while Mick Mulvaney is killing the consumer agency’s probe into the Equifax breach. Mick Mulvaney shoots another middle finger at consumers.”[56]\n\n","Following the announcement of the May–July 2017 breach, Equifax's actions received widespread criticism. Equifax did not immediately disclose whether PINs\nand other sensitive information were compromised, nor did it explain the delay between its discovery of the breach in July and its public announcement in early September.[57]\n\nEquifax stated that the delay was due to the time needed to determine the scope of the intrusion and the large amount of personal data involved.[58]\n\n","It was also revealed that three Equifax executives sold almost $1.8 million of their personal holdings of company shares days after Equifax discovered the breach but more than a month before the breach was made public.[59]\n\nThe company said the executives, including the chief financial officer John Gamble,[60]\n\n[27]\n\n\"had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred at the time they sold their shares\".[61]\n\nOn September 18, Bloomberg\nreported that the US Justice Department\nhad opened an investigation to determine whether or not insider trading laws had been violated.[62]\n\n","When publicly revealing the intrusion to its systems, Equifax offered a website (https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com[63]\n\n) for consumers to learn whether they were victims of the breach. Security experts quickly noted that the website had many traits in common with a phishing\nwebsite: it was not hosted on a domain registered to Equifax, it had a flawed TLS implementation, and it ran on WordPress\nwhich is not generally considered suitable for high-security applications.[17]\n\nThese issues led Open DNS\nto classify it as a phishing site and block access.[17]\n\nMoreover, members of the public wanting to use the Equifax website to learn if their data had been compromised had to provide a last name and six digits of their social security number.[64]\n\n","The website set up to check whether a person's personal data had been breached (trustedidpremier.com) was determined by security experts and others to return apparently random results instead of accurate information.[64]\n\nAs with https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, this website, too, was registered and constructed like a phishing website, and it was flagged as such by several web browsers.[65]\n\n","The Trusted ID Premier website contained terms of use\n, dated September 6, 2017 (the day before Equifax announced the security breach) which included an arbitration clause\nwith a class action waiver.[66]\n\n[67]\n\nAttorneys said that the arbitration clause was ambiguous and that it could require consumers who accepted it to arbitrate claims related to the cybersecurity incident.[67]\n\nAccording to Polly Mosendz and Shahien Nasiripour, \"some fear[ed] that simply using an Equifax website to check whether their information was compromised bound them to arbitration\".[68]\n\nThe equifax.com website has separate terms of use with an arbitration clause and class action waiver, but, according to Brian Fung of The Washington Post\n, \"it's unclear if that applies to the credit monitoring program\".[69]\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\ndemanded that Equifax remove the arbitration clause.[70]\n\nResponding to arbitration-related concerns, on September 8, Equifax issued a statement stating that \"in response to consumer inquiries, we have made it clear that the arbitration clause and class action waiver included in the Equifax and TrustedID Premier terms of use does not apply to this cybersecurity incident.\"[70]\n\nJoel Winston, a data protection lawyer, argued that the announcement disclaiming the arbitration clause \"means nothing\" because the terms of use state that they are the \"entire agreement\" between the parties.[70]\n\nThe arbitration clause was later removed from equifaxsecurity2017.com,[70]\n\nand the equifax.com terms of use were amended on September 12 to state that they do not apply to www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, www.trustedidpremier.com, or www.trustedid.com and to exclude claims arising from those sites or the security breach from arbitration.[71]\n\n[72]\n\n","Responding to continuing public outrage,[73]\n\nEquifax announced on September 12 that they \"are waiving all Security Freeze fees for the next 30 days\".[74]\n\n","Equifax has been criticized by security experts for registering a new domain name for the site name instead of using a subdomain of equifax.com\n. On September 20, it was reported that Equifax had been mistakenly linking to an unofficial \"fake\" web site instead of their own breach notification site in at least eight separate tweets\n, unwittingly helping to direct a reported 200,000 hits to the imitation site. A software engineer named Nick Sweeting created the unauthorized Equifax web site to demonstrate how the official site could easily be confused with a phishing\nsite. Sweeting's site was upfront to visitors that it was not official, however, telling visitors who had entered sensitive information that \"you just got bamboozled! this isnt [sic] a secure site! Tweet to @equifax to get them to change it to equifax.com before thousands of people loose [sic] their info to phishing sites!\n\" Equifax apologized for the \"confusion\" and deleted the tweets linking to this site.[75]\n\n[76]\n\n[77]\n\n","In September 2017, Brian Krebs\nrevealed that an Argentinian arm of Equifax had left private data from approximately 14,000 consumers, and more than 100 staff members, available to anyone who entered \"admin\" as both the username and password for one of its online systems.[78]\n\n[79]\n\n","On September 7, 2017, the same day as Equifax announced a large security breach\n, Equifax removed its official mobile apps\nfrom the Apple App Store\nand from Google Play\n.[80]\n\nWhile these apps themselves were not reportedly connected to that breach, they had security flaws of their own, being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks\nowing to some parts using HTTP\ninstead of HTTPS\n.[81]\n\n","On October 8, 2017, Krebs reported that The Work Number\n, a website operated by Equifax's TALX\ndivision, exposed the salary histories for employees of tens of thousands of US companies to anyone in possession of the employee's Social Security Number and date of birth.[82]\n\n[83]\n\nFor roughly half the US population, both of the latter pieces of data are known to be in possession of criminals, following Equifax's May–July 2017 security breach\n.[82]\n\n[83]\n\n","On October 12, 2017, Equifax's website was reported to have been offering visitors malware\nvia drive-by download\n.[84]\n\n[85]\n\nThe malware was disguised as an update for Adobe Flash\n.[84]\n\n[85]\n\n[86]\n\n[87]\n\nAt that time, only 3 out of 65 top anti-malware products provided protection against the particular malware, meaning that many visitors were at risk of having their computers infected if visiting the Equifax website.[86]\n\n","On October 13, 2017, the attack was revealed to have been performed by hijacking third-party analytics\nJavaScript\nfrom Digital River\nbrand FireClick.[88]\n\n[89]\n\n","Also on October 13, 2017, the US Internal Revenue Service\nwas reported to have suspended a $7.2 million contract with Equifax, as a result of the attack.[90]\n\n","The company has been fined by the Federal Trade Commission on two occasions for violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In 2000, Equifax, along with Experian and TransUnion, was fined $2.5 million for blocking and delaying phone calls from consumers trying to get information about their credit. In 2003, the FTC took Equifax to court for the same reason and settled its lawsuit with the company for a fine of $250,000.[91]\n\n[92]\n\n","In July 2013, a federal jury in Oregon awarded $18.6 million to Julie Miller of Marion County against Equifax for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.ad'_St._Louis_County_woman_pleads_to_her_bank_93-0\" class=\"reference\"\u003edead'_St._Louis_County_woman_pleads_to_her_bank-93\"\u003e[93]\n\nIn her lawsuit, Miller alleged Equifax had merged her credit reports with another person with a different Social Security number, date of birth, and address. Miller contacted Equifax repeatedly in writing and over the telephone, but Equifax refused to delete dozens of false collection accounts from Miller’s credit report.[94]\n\nThe award included $18.4 million in punitive damages, and $180,000 in compensatory damages. Miller’s lawyer, Justin Baxter, explained that the false reporting damaged Miller's reputation, she was denied credit, and her private information was given to businesses Miller had no relationship with.[95]\n\nThe jury’s verdict is believed to be the largest award in an individual case under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.[96]\n\nAn Equifax spokesperson said that Equifax is considering appealing the jury’s verdict.[97]\n\nA federal judge reduced the award to $1.62 million in 2014.[98]\n\n","In 2014, Equifax and Heartland Bank were sued by Kimberly Haman of the St. Louis area for reporting she was dead.[99]\n\n[100]\n\nA Heartland Bank spokesperson said the bank \"immediately investigated and contacted the credit reporting agencies after Haman reported\" she was still alive.[99]\n\nAn Equifax \"spokesperson told the Post-Dispatch that Equifax blocked the Heartland account information from appearing on Haman’s credit report after a reporter’s inquiry.\"_93-1\" class=\"reference\"\u003enk-93\"\u003e[93]\n\n[99]\n\n","In April 2014, Equifax was sued in New York federal court by God Gazarov, who claimed the company erroneously reports him as having no credit history because of his unusual first name.p id=\"cite_ref-God_Just_Wants_Some_Credit,_So_He's_Suing_Equifax_101-0\" class=\"reference\"\u003ehref=\"#cite_note-God_Just_Wants_Some_Credit,_So_He's_Suing_Equifax-101\"\u003e[101]\n\n","p id=\"cite_ref-God_Just_Wants_Some_Credit,_So_He's_Suing_Equifax_101-0\" class=\"reference\"\u003ehref=\"#cite_note-God_Just_Wants_Some_Credit,_So_He's_Suing_Equifax-101\"\u003e[101]\n","href=\"#cite_note-God_Just_Wants_Some_Credit,_So_He's_Suing_Equifax-101\"\u003e[101]","On November 4, 2015, it was reported that a group of five Oklahomans had sued the company, claiming that Equifax \"violated laws which require financial institutions to protect the security of their customers' personal information.\"[102]\n\nEquifax selected the law firm DLA Piper\nto work on the case in D.C.

Deloitte was the first person to be appointed an independent auditor of a public company, namely the Great Western Railway\n.[15]\n\nHe went on to open an office in New York in 1880.[15]\n\n\nIn 1896, Charles Waldo Haskins\nand Elijah Watt Sells\nformed Haskins \u0026amp; Sells in New York.[15]\n\nIt was later described as \"the first major auditing firm to be established in the country by American rather than British accountants.\"[16]\n\n\nIn 1898, George Touche\nestablished an office in London and then, in 1900, joined John Ballantine Niven in establishing the firm of Touche Niven in the Johnston Building at 30 Broad Street\nin New York.[15]\n\n\nOn 1 March 1933, Colonel Arthur Hazelton Carter, President of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants and managing partner of Haskins \u0026amp; Sells, testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking and Currency\n. Carter helped convince Congress\nthat independent audits should be mandatory for public companies\n.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Welch Deloitte, founder of Deloitte\n\n\nIn 1947, Detroit\naccountant George Bailey, then president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants\n, launched his own organization. The new entity enjoyed such a positive start that in less than a year, the partners merged with Touche Niven and A. R. Smart to form Touche, Niven, Bailey \u0026amp; Smart.[15]\n\nHeaded by Bailey, the organization grew rapidly, in part by creating a dedicated management consulting\nfunction. It also forged closer links with organizations established by the co-founder of Touche Niven, George Touche: the Canadian organization Ross and the British organization George A. Touche.[15]\n\nIn 1960, the firm was renamed Touche, Ross, Bailey \u0026amp; Smart, becoming Touche Ross in 1969.[15]\n\nIn 1968 Nobuzo Tohmatsu\nformed Tohmatsu Aoki \u0026amp; Co, a firm based in Japan that was to become part of the Touche Ross network in 1975.[15]\n\nIn 1972 Robert Trueblood, Chairman of Touche Ross, led the committee responsible for recommending the establishment of the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n.[15]\n\n\nIn 1952, Deloitte merged his firm (by then known as Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths \u0026amp; Co.) with Haskins \u0026amp; Sells to form Deloitte Haskins \u0026amp; Sells.[17]\n\n\nIn 1989, Deloitte Haskins \u0026amp; Sells merged with Touche Ross in the USA to form Deloitte \u0026amp; Touche. The merged firm was led jointly by J. Michael Cook and Edward A. Kangas. Led by the UK partnership, a smaller number of Deloitte Haskins \u0026amp; Sells member firms rejected the merger with Touche Ross and shortly thereafter merged with Coopers \u0026amp; Lybrand to form Coopers \u0026amp; Lybrand Deloitte (later to merge with Price Waterhouse to become PwC\n).[18]\n\nSome member firms of Touche Ross also rejected the merger with Deloitte Haskins \u0026amp; Sells and merged with other firms.[18]\n\nIn UK, Touche Ross merged with Spicer \u0026amp; Oppenheim in 1990.[19]\n\n\nRecent history\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nAt the time of the US-led mergers to form Deloitte \u0026amp; Touche, the name of the international firm was a problem, because there was no worldwide exclusive access to the names \"Deloitte\" or \"Touche Ross\" – key member firms such as Deloitte in the UK and Touche Ross in Australia had not joined the merger. The name DRT International was therefore chosen, referring to Deloitte, Ross and Tohmatsu. In 1993, the international firm was renamed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeloitte Office Building in Downtown Chicago\n\n\nIn 1995, the partners of Deloitte \u0026amp; Touche decided to create Deloitte \u0026amp; Touche Consulting Group (now known as Deloitte Consulting).[20]\n\n\nIn 2000, Deloitte acquired Eclipse to add Internet design-based solutions to its consulting capabilities. Eclipse was later separated into Deloitte Online and Deloitte Digital.[21]\n\n\nIn 2002, Arthur Andersen\n's UK practice, the firm's largest practice outside the US, agreed to merge with Deloitte's UK practice. Andersen's practices in Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Mexico, Brazil and Canada also agreed to merge with Deloitte.[22]\n\n[23]\n\nThe spinoff of Deloitte France's consulting division led to the creation of Ineum Consulting\n.[24]\n\n\nIn 2005, Deloitte acquired Beijing Pan-China CPA to become the largest accountancy firm in China. Just prior to this acquisition Deloitte China had about 3,200 employees. This acquisition was part of a five-year plan to invest $150 million in China. Deloitte has had a presence in China since 1917.[25]\n\n\nIn 2007, Deloitte began hiring former employees of the Central Intelligence Agency\n(CIA) for their competitive intelligence\nunit known as Deloitte Intelligence.[26]\n\n\nIn 2009, Deloitte purchased the North American public service practice of BearingPoint\n(formerly KPMG\nConsulting) for $350 million after it filed for bankruptcy protection. [27]\n\n\nDeloitte LLP took over the UK property consultants Drivers Jonas\nin January 2010. As of 2013, this business unit was known as Deloitte Real Estate.[28]\n\n\nIn 2011, Deloitte acquired DOMANI Sustainability Consulting and ClearCarbon Consulting in order to expand its sustainability service offerings.[29]\n\n\nIn January 2012, Deloitte announced the acquisition of Übermind, a mobile advertising agency.[30]\n\nThe acquisition marked Deloitte's first entrance into the mobile application field.[31]\n\n\nIn November 2012, Deloitte acquired Recombinant Data Corporation, a company specializing in data warehousing\nand clinical intelligence solutions, and launched Recombinant by Deloitte.[32]\n\nIn February 2013 Recombinant by Deloitte merged with an internal informatics\nunit (Deloitte Health Informatics) and launched ConvergeHEALTH by Deloitte.[33]\n\n\nOn 11 January 2013, Deloitte acquired substantially all of the business of Monitor Group\n,[34]\n\nthe strategy consulting firm founded by Harvard Business School\nprofessor Michael Porter\n, after Monitor filed for bankruptcy protection.[35]\n\n\nIn 2014 the company introduced Rubix, a blockchain\nconsultancy providing advisory services for clients in different business sectors, including government. In 2016 the company created its first blockchain lab in Dublin. A second hub was launched in New York in January 2017. In 2016, Deloitte Canada set-up a Bitcoin automatic teller machine and equipped a restaurant in its office complex to accept bitcoin as payment. Deloitte CIS partnered with Waves Platform to offering services related to initial coin offerings\n. Deloitte became a member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance\nand the Hyperledger Project sponsored by the Linux Foundation\nin May 2017.[36]\n\n[37]\n\n\nIn 2016, Deloitte acquired advertising agency Heat of San Francisco, best known for its work Madden NFL\nfrom EA Sports\nand the Hotwire\ntravel website. Heat was the 11th digital marketing agency purchased by Deloitte Digital since its founding in 2012. As of 2016, Deloitte Digital had 7,000 employees. It billed $2.1 billion in 2015, making it one of world's largest digital agencies.[38]\n\n[39]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Apple Inc.\nannounced a partnership with Deloitte aimed at boosting sales of its phones and other mobile devices to businesses. As part of the partnership, the two companies will launch a service called Enterprise Next, in which more than 5,000 Deloitte consultants will advise clients on how to make better use of Apple products and services.[40]\n\n[41]\n\n[42]\n\n\nIn October 2016, Deloitte announced that they were creating Deloitte North West Europe. The Belgian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish member firms will combine with the UK and Swiss member firms to create Deloitte North West Europe. Deloitte, over the next three years, will invest €200m to enhance its services to its global, national and private market clients and to create the best development opportunities. The firm will come into effect on 1 June 2017 and it is estimated to have 28,000 partners and people generating over €5bn in annual revenue. Deloitte North West Europe will account for approximately 20% of all revenue within their Global Network. [43]\n\n\nName and branding\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeloitte logo (Short)\n\n\nWhile in 1989, in most countries, Deloitte, Haskins \u0026amp; Sells merged with Touche Ross forming Deloitte \u0026amp; Touche, in the United Kingdom the local firm of Deloitte, Haskins \u0026amp; Sells merged instead with Coopers \u0026amp; Lybrand (later renamed PwC).[44]\n\n\nWhile the full name of the UK private company is Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited\n, in 1989 it initially branded itself DTT International\n. In 2003, the rebranding campaign was commissioned by William G. Parrett\n, the then-CEO of DTT, and led by Jerry Leamon, the global Clients and Markets leader.[45]\n\n\nAccording to the company website, Deloitte now refers to the brand under which independent firms throughout the world collaborate to provide audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk management, and tax services to selected clients.[46]\n\n\nIn 2008, Deloitte adopted its new \"Always One Step Ahead\" (AOSA) brand positioning platform to support the existing Deloitte vision: \"To be the Standard of Excellence\". AOSA represents the global organization's value proposition and is never used as a tagline. The recent launch of the Green Dot ad campaign also aligns with Deloitte's brand strategy and positioning framework.[47]\n\n\nIn June 2016, Deloitte changed its branding and adopted a new logo with Deloitte written in black color instead of earlier blue.[48]\n\n\nLegal structure\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nFor many years, the organization and its network of member firms were legally organized as a Swiss Verein\n(the equivalent to an unincorporated association). As of 31 July 2010, members of the Verein became part of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (DTTL), a UK private company, limited by guarantee. Each member firm in its global network remains a separate and independent legal entity, subject to the laws and professional regulations\nof the particular country or countries in which it operates.[49]\n\nDeloitte is registered under the NAIC\ncode of 55112.[50]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30 Rockefeller Center\n\n\n\nThis structure is similar to other professional services networks\nwhich seek to limit vicarious liability for acts of other members. As separate and legal entities, member firms and DTTL cannot obligate each other. Professional services continue to be provided by member firms only and not DTTL. With this structure, the members should not be liable for the negligence of other independent members. This structure also allows them to be members of the IFAC\nForum of Firms.[51]\n\n\nServices\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nDeloitte member firms offer services in the following functions, with country-specific variations on their legal implementation (i.e., all operating within a single company or through separate legal entities operating as subsidiaries of an umbrella legal entity for the country).[5]\n\n\nAudit\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nAudit provides the organization's traditional accounting and audit services, as well as internal auditing and IT control assurance. In 2017, it accounted for 24% of worldwide revenue share.[5]\n\n\nGuangdong Kelon Electrical Holdings controversy\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nInvestors in Guangdong Kelon Electrical Holdings Company Limited\nhave claimed that there was a failure to alert them to the company's poor financial position.[52]\n\n[53]\n\nDeloitte claims it did a good job on the project. Deloitte's global CEO defended the firm's work on the Kelon matter. The firm was the auditor for thirty months from 2002 to 2004. It qualified its opinion in 2004 as to company sales, returns, and allowances. The firm resigned from the Kelon account after completing the 2004 audit. Deloitte said it resigned from the account because management at the client was not committed to best practices in finance.[54]\n\n\nConsulting\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nConsulting assists clients by providing services in the areas of enterprise applications\n, technology integration\n, strategy \u0026amp; operations\n, human capital\n, and short-term outsourcing\n. In 2017, consulting accounted for 37% of worldwide revenue share.[5]\n\n\nConsulting controversies\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn An American Sickness\n(2017), Dr. Elisabeth Rosenthal\nattributed to Deloitte a key role in counseling the adoption of \"strategic billing\" as a way of increasing revenues from hospital business. She dates this development from 2005, when Deloitte hired Tommy Thompson\n, former secretary of health and human services, as chairman of its global healthcare practice.[55]\n\nIn 2011, Deloitte was ranked No. 1 by revenue in all areas of healthcare consulting—life sciences, payer, provider, and government health.[56]\n\n\n\nThe firm implemented the SAP\nHR\nsystem for the Los Angeles Unified School District\n(LAUSD) for $95 million and because of faults in the system, some teachers were underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all.[57]\n\nAs of 31 December 2007, LAUSD had incurred a total of $140 million in payments to Deloitte to get the system working properly.[58]\n\nIn 2008, there was some evidence that the payroll issues had started to stabilize with errors below 1% according to LAUSD's chief operating officer.[59]\n\n\n\nThe firm worked on a statewide case management system which originally had a budget of around $260 million. Almost $500 million had been spent and costs were at one time projected to potentially run as high as $2 billion. No single court became fully operational.[60]\n\nCalifornia's Judicial Council terminated the project in 2012 citing actual deployment costs associated with the project and California's budget concerns.[61]\n\n\n\nFinancial advisory\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nFinancial advisory provides corporate finance\nservices to clients, including dispute, personal and commercial bankruptcy\n, forensics, e-discovery, document review, advisory, mergers \u0026amp; acquisitions, capital projects consulting and valuation services. In 2017, financial advisory accounted for 9% of worldwide revenue.[5]\n\n\nRisk advisory\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nRisk advisory provides offerings in enterprise risk management\n, information security\nand privacy, data quality and integrity, project risk and business continuity management and sustainability. In 2017, risk advisory accounted for 12% of worldwide revenue.[5]\n\n\n\nTax \u0026amp; legal\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nTax \u0026amp; legal helps clients increase their net asset value, undertake the transfer pricing and international tax activities of multinational companies, minimize their tax liabilities, implement tax computer systems, and provides advisory of tax implications of various business decisions. In 2017, tax \u0026amp; legal accounted for 19% of worldwide revenue.[5]\n\n\nTax treaties controversy\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn November 2013, the international development charity ActionAid accused Deloitte of advising large businesses on how they could use Mauritius\nto avoid potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of tax in some of the poorest countries in Africa. Deloitte responded by saying that, in the absence of the double-taxation treaties, they advise their clients to avail themselves of arrangements that could result in less taxes being paid to the countries in question. Deloitte also said it was wrong to say it is tax avoidance to make use of provisions in double tax treaties and that without such treaties investment might be reduced.[62]\n\n\nOffices\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nNotable Deloitte office buildings\n\n\nb/1/14/Q22_Warszawa_2016.jpg/248px-Q22_Warszawa_2016.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"4068\" data-file-height=\"6556\" /\u003e\n\n\n\n\nQ22\n– Deloitte's Polish HQ\nin Warsaw\n, Poland\n\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLondon\n, UK\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOslo\n, Norway\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDe Haagsche Zwaan, The Hague\n, The Netherlands\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTorre Mayor\n, Mexico City\n, Mexico\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopenhagen\n, Denmark\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParramatta\n, Australia\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVienna\n, Austria\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShin-Marunouchi Building\n, Tokyo\n, Japan\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLos Angeles\n, USA\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBudapest\n, Hungary\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTorre Picasso\n, Madrid\n, Spain\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeloitte Centre\n, Auckland\n, New Zealand\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAzrieli Center\n, Tel Aviv\n, Israel\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIFC Seoul\n, Seoul\n, South Korea\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaastoren\n, Rotterdam\n, The Netherlands\u0026#160;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwards and recognition\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn 2016, Fortune\n\nmagazine ranked Deloitte as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For[63]\n\nand Bloomberg Business has consistently named Deloitte as the best place to launch a career.[64]\n\n\nDeloitte, along with KPMG\n, PwC\nand PA Consulting Group\nwere recognized among the UK's best companies to work for in 2017.[65]\n\n\nDeloitte was named the #1 accounting firm for the ninth year in a row by Inside Public Accounting in August 2017.[66]\n\n\nIn 2017, Deloitte was ranked as one of the ten best places to work for paternity leave by Fatherly\n, an online resource for parenting news.[67]\n\n\nLitigation and regulatory action\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nAdelphia Communications\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission\nannounced on 26 April 2005 that Deloitte had agreed to pay $50 million to settle charges relating to Adelphia's 2000 financial statements.[68]\n\n[69]\n\nThe settlement was later reported to be as high as $210m or $167.5m.[70]\n\n[71]\n\n\nLivent\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn proceedings arising from the insolvency of the former entertainment company Livent\n, in April 2014 its special receiver obtained judgment against Deloitte for $84,750,000 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice\n, in relation to Deloitte's failure to exercise its duty of care\nwith respect to the audit of Livent's financial statements during 1993–1998.[72]\n\nThe ruling was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal\nin January 2016,[73]\n\n[74]\n\n[75]\n\nbut in December 2017, the Supreme Court of Canada\nin Deloitte \u0026amp; Touche v Livent Inc (Receiver of)\n\nallowed an appeal in part, declaring that liability existed only in respect of Deloitte's negligence in conducting the audit for Livent's 1997 fiscal year\n, and accordingly reduced the amount of damages awarded to $40,425,000.[76]\n\n\nStandard Chartered\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn August 2012, Deloitte Financial Advisory Services (DFAS) publicly denied that as the official internal auditors for Standard Chartered\n, it helped the bank cover up money laundering operations related to Iran which were earning the bank significant profits by \"intentionally omitting critical information\".[77]\n\nDFAS paid the state of New York a $10 million settlement, was required not to take on new business for one year from designated New York banks, and was required to implement reforms in order to prevent similar problems in the future. The state regulator stated that there was no evidence DFAS intentionally helped Standard Chartered launder money.[78]\n\n\nControversies\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nAustralian tobacco industry\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn 2011, Deloitte was commissioned by the tobacco industry to compile a report on illicit tobacco\n. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service\nofficials called the report \"potentially misleading,\" and raised concerns about the \"reliability and accuracy\" of the data.[79]\n\nWhen a second Deloitte report focusing on counterfeit\ncigarettes was released, Home Affairs Minister ician)\" title=\"Brendan O'Connor (politician)\"\u003eBrendan O'Connor\ndescribed the second report as \"baseless and deceptive\" and \"bogus\".[80]\n\nPublic health officials criticised Deloitte's decision to conduct the research, as it added credibility to the tobacco industry's effort to undermine the Australian Government\n's plain cigarette packaging\nlegislation.[81]\n\n[82]\n\n\nCanadian Bar Association\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn September 2003, Deloitte reported to the California Bar Association\n(CBA) that motor vehicle accident insurance claims for bodily injury had been declining since 1999 adjusted for inflation. This contradicted the government\n's and industry\n's argument that general damages\nfor soft-tissue injury had to be capped at $4,000. Within hours of release, a member of Deloitte was communicating with Insurance Bureau of Canada without the knowledge of CBA (their client) and providing confidential information. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Alberta found Deloitte guilty of unprofessional conduct and fined the firm $40,000.[83]\n\n[dead link\n\n\n]\n\n\nE-mail hack\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn September 2017, The Guardian\nreported that Deloitte suffered a cyberattack that breached the confidentiality of its clients and 244,000 staff, allowing the attackers to access \"usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information\". Reportedly, Deloitte had stored the affected data in Microsoft's Azure\ncloud hosting service, without two-step verification\n. The attackers were thought to possibly have had access from as early as October 2016.[84]\n\nBrian Krebs\nreported that the breach affected all of Deloitte's email and administrative user\naccounts.[85]\n\n[86]\n\nA later report by The Wall Street Journal\nrepeated Deloitte's statement that only a few clients were affected. Deloitte said that neither its services nor its clients' businesses were disrupted. Deloitte reportedly first noticed suspicious activity in April 2017. Deloitte said that no sensitive information was compromised and that its investigators were eventually able to read every email obtained by the hackers.[87]\n\n\nThe Guardian\nreported that client accounts compromised in the breach included, but were not limited to, the US Department of Defense\n, the US Department of Homeland Security\n, the US State Department\n, the US Department of Energy\n, mortgage companies Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac\n, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n, and the US Postal Service\n.[88]\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac issued statements saying they were not affected by the attack and denied that any of their data was compromised.[89]\n\n\nDeloitte said that it immediately contacted legal authorities and six clients. Deloitte also increased security measures on the advice of both internal and external experts.[90]\n\nAs of October 2017, the New York attorney general's office was investigating the hack.[87]\n\n\nSponsorships\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nDeloitte LLP serves as the official professional services sponsor of the United States Olympic Committee\nsince year 2009.[91]\n\nThe UK member firm of Deloitte was a sponsor of the London 2012 Olympics\n[92]\n\nand the Royal Opera House\n.[93]\n\nThe Canadian member firm was also the official professional services supplier for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games\n[94]\n\nand 2010 Winter Paralympic Games\n.[95]\n\nIn Asia, the Singapore member firm of Deloitte was a sponsor of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics\n.[96]\n\n\nMoreover, Deloitte sponsors many university sports teams and societies, such as Edinburgh University Hockey Club\n.[97]\n\nIt also entered into a 3-year partnership with the Cambridge Union Society\nin November 2013.[98]\n\n\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n\n\nNew York City portal\n\n\n\n\nCompanies portal\n\n\n\n\nAccounting networks and associations\n\nDeloitte Fast 500\n\nDeloitte Football Money League\n\nProfessional services networks\n\nSarbanes–Oxley Act\n\nTax advisor\n\n\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n^\n\n\n\"About Deloitte\"\n. 2.deloitte.com\n.

Deloitte was the first person to be appointed an independent auditor of a public company, namely the Great Western Railway\n.[15]\n\nHe went on to open an office in New York in 1880.[15]\n\n","In 1896, Charles Waldo Haskins\nand Elijah Watt Sells\nformed Haskins \u0026amp; Sells in New York.[15]\n\nIt was later described as \"the first major auditing firm to be established in the country by American rather than British accountants.\"[16]\n\n","In 1898, George Touche\nestablished an office in London and then, in 1900, joined John Ballantine Niven in establishing the firm of Touche Niven in the Johnston Building at 30 Broad Street\nin New York.[15]\n\n","On 1 March 1933, Colonel Arthur Hazelton Carter, President of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants and managing partner of Haskins \u0026amp; Sells, testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking and Currency\n. Carter helped convince Congress\nthat independent audits should be mandatory for public companies\n.[15]\n\n","In 1947, Detroit\naccountant George Bailey, then president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants\n, launched his own organization. The new entity enjoyed such a positive start that in less than a year, the partners merged with Touche Niven and A. R. Smart to form Touche, Niven, Bailey \u0026amp; Smart.[15]\n\nHeaded by Bailey, the organization grew rapidly, in part by creating a dedicated management consulting\nfunction.

As separate and legal entities, member firms and DTTL cannot obligate each other. Professional services continue to be provided by member firms only and not DTTL. With this structure, the members should not be liable for the negligence of other independent members. This structure also allows them to be members of the IFAC\nForum of Firms.[51]\n\n","Deloitte member firms offer services in the following functions, with country-specific variations on their legal implementation (i.e., all operating within a single company or through separate legal entities operating as subsidiaries of an umbrella legal entity for the country).[5]\n\n","Audit provides the organization's traditional accounting and audit services, as well as internal auditing and IT control assurance.

Deloitte responded by saying that, in the absence of the double-taxation treaties, they advise their clients to avail themselves of arrangements that could result in less taxes being paid to the countries in question.

Disqus was first incorporated and launched on October 30, 2007.","In early 2011, Disqus raised $10 million in funding from North Bridge Venture Partners and Union Square Ventures\n.[7]\n\n","According to a study by Lijit, Disqus was used by 75% of websites in March 2011 who used a third-party commenting or discussion system.[8]\n\n","On December 5, 2017, Zeta Global\nannounced that it had acquired Disqus for an undisclosed amount.[9]\n\n[10]\n\nIn a blog post, Disqus stated that it plans to continue operations as normal.[11]\n\n","The Disqus comment widget\nis written in JavaScript\nand is powered by a back end primarily written in Python\nusing the Django\nframework.","Disqus operates on the freemium\nfinancial model similar to Dropbox\nand Evernote\n. The service is free to use for both commenters and web sites. Web sites can pay fees to unlock additional features.","In November 2010 Disqus began officially offering three add-on packages for web sites: Plus for $19/month, Pro for $199/month, and VIP starting at $999/month.[12]\n\nIn mid-2011, the Plus package was removed and Pro was increased to $299/month.","Starting July 2012, Disqus offered just two premium packages, the VIP package and a single-sign-on\n-only package for $99/month.","Premium packages were quietly phased out beginning March 2013.","On January 4, 2017 Disqus announced new premium packages rolling out in March 2017.[13]\n\nA later blog post clarified that over 95% of sites using Disqus, mostly personal blogs and non-commercial sites, will be unaffected by the new premium model.[14]\n\nPricing[promotional language\n\n\n]\nis as follows:[15]\n\n","As of 2017, Disqus offers several subscription plans:[16]\n\n[17]\n\n[18]\n\n","Disqus Basic is a free, ads-supported plan. It includes access to the core functionality of Disqus, including:","Disqus Plus includes all the features of Basic, plus the ability to turn off ads.","Disqus Pro includes all features from Plus including:[19]\n\n","Disqus Business is an enterprise plan that is configurable to a site's needs.","Both the Disqus site and comment system were translated into more than sixty languages in 2011. With the introduction of the new Disqus in 2012, language support dropped to seven languages[20]\n\nand even though Disqus accepts applications for new languages,[21]\n\nonly one has been added since bringing the current number of supported languages to eight as of 2013[update]\n\n.","As of 2017[22]\n\n, Disqus is translated in 36 languages including Spanish, French, Japanese, and Chinese using crowd-sourced translation on Transifex\n.[23]\n\n","Privacy\nissues have been noted as inherent in the use of services like Disqus, which serve their content through third-party JavaScript\nwidgets\n.[24]\n\n[25]\n\n[26]\n\n","As with other embedded web widgets\n, such as like buttons\n, the Disqus widget acts as a web bug\nwhich tracks a user's activities, even when they are not logged in, across different sites that use the Disqus commenting system. Information tracked by Disqus, which may be disclosed to third parties, includes pseudonymous\nanalytics data, such as a user's IP address\n, their web browser\nversion and installed add-ons, and their referring pages\nand exit links.[27]\n\nAlthough these data are referred to by Disqus as \"Non-Personally Identifiable Information\", such data, when aggregated, has been shown to be usable for de-anonymizing\nusers.[25]\n\n","Disqus has also been criticized for publishing its registered users' entire commenting histories, along with a list of connected blogs and services, on the publicly viewable user profile pages.[28]\n\nThe option to keep profile activity private was later added.","Users wishing to avoid these issues may opt to install a privacy-enhancing web browser extension, such as Ghostery\n, NoScript\n, or DoNotTrackMe\n, which identify widgets such as Disqus as web bugs,[29]\n\n[30]\n\nand allow them to be blocked; this renders Disqus-powered commenting sections unviewable.","Disqus does not moderate communities which use its service,[31]\n\nleading to controversial moderation in some communities. Disqus only intervenes when the Terms of Service have been violated, leading to criticisms that Disqus allows racist and otherwise offensive content to be created on the platform.","Disqus also was criticized for not giving users control over who follows them. Prior to 2014, any user could follow any other user, but a user being followed could not control or block who was following them, which led to harassment among some users.[32]\n\n","If Disqus shuts down, hundreds of millions of comments would be wiped away from a wide range of sites, since by the very nature of the service, comment content is not being managed locally by sites implementing the service. However, it is possible for site administrators to export all of their comments as an XML\ndocument which can then be ported into other commenting systems.[33]\n\n","In September 2014, it announced an update to its privacy policy\n: \"Disqus will be using anonymous interest data for content personalization and ad targeting.\"[34]\n\n","In 2013 a Swedish group called Researchgruppen\nobtained and exposed a large number of anonymous Disqus identities through the application programming interface\n(API).[35]\n\nThe group cooperated with the Bonnier\ntabloid Expressen\n\n, who subsequently visited some of the commentators in their homes, confronting them with allegedly racist\n, misogynic\n, and derogatory sentiments. Researchgruppen said their database contained millions of comments from Disqus users around the world who are at risk of de-anonymization\n.[36]\n\n[37]\n\n[38]\n\nIn March 2014, Expressen\nand Researchgruppen won the investigative reporting\naward Guldspaden.[39]\n\n","On October 6 2017, Disqus announced that a snapshot of its database from 2012, containing 17.5 million users' email addresses, login names and sign-up dates from between 2007-2012, had been exposed.[40]\n\nThe data dump also included, for about a third of the affected accounts, passwords that had been salted and hashed with SHA1\n.[40]\n\n[41]\n\n[42]\n\n[43]\n\n","Previously, if a user attempted to delete their comment, Disqus \"anonymized\" their comment by changing the author to a Guest user, without removing the content of the body itself.[44]\n\nThe only recourse at that time was to flag the comment, contact the site moderator to delete the anonymized Guest comment, or to remember to edit out the body of the comment before deleting a comment.","In April 2015, Disqus revised their Delete button to completely delete a comment from the website.[45]\n\n[46]\n\n"],"title":"Disqus","rels":["/wiki/Shadow_banning","/wiki/Single_sign-on","/wiki/Blog_comment_hosting_service","/wiki/February_2010_Australian_cyberattacks","/wiki/Operation_Aurora","/wiki/Operation_Payback","/wiki/DigiNotar","/wiki/HBGary","/wiki/Operation_AntiSec","/wiki/Operation_Tunisia","/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage","/wiki/RSA_SecurID#March_2011_system_compromise","/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack","/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak","/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack","/wiki/Snapchat#December_2013_hack","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#August_2013_breach","/wiki/Anthem_medical_data_breach","/wiki/Operation_Tovar","/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos","/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack","/wiki/2014_Russian_hacker_password_theft","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach","/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach","/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach","/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach","/wiki/VTech#2015_data_breach","/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack","/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery","/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center#Ransomware","/wiki/Commission_on_Elections_data_breach","/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack","/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/2017_Westminster_cyberattack","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/2017_cyberattacks_on_Ukraine","/wiki/Equifax#May–July_2017_data_breach","/wiki/Deloitte#2016–17_email_hack","/wiki/Disqus#October_2017_security_breach","/wiki/Anonymous_(group)","/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous","/wiki/Bureau_121","/wiki/Cozy_Bear","/wiki/CyberBerkut","/wiki/Derp_(hacker_group)","/wiki/Equation_Group","/wiki/Fancy_Bear","/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America","/wiki/Goatse_Security","/wiki/Guccifer_2.0","/wiki/Hacking_Team","/wiki/Iranian_Cyber_Army","/wiki/Lizard_Squad","/wiki/LulzRaft","/wiki/LulzSec","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack#Perpetrators","/wiki/NullCrew","/wiki/NSO_Group","/wiki/PayPal_14","/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398","/wiki/PLATINUM_(cybercrime_group)","/wiki/Pranknet","/wiki/RedHack","/wiki/Rocket_Kitten","/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers","/wiki/Syrian_Electronic_Army","/wiki/TeaMp0isoN","/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations","/wiki/UGNazi","/wiki/Yemen_Cyber_Army","/wiki/George_Hotz","/wiki/Guccifer","/wiki/Hector_Monsegur","/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond","/wiki/Junaid_Hussain","/wiki/Kristoffer_von_Hassel","/wiki/Mustafa_Al-Bassam","/wiki/MLT_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Ryan_Ackroyd","/wiki/Topiary_(hacktivist)","/wiki/The_Jester_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Weev","/wiki/Evercookie","/wiki/ISeeYou","/wiki/Heartbleed","/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)","/wiki/POODLE","/wiki/Rootpipe","/wiki/Row_hammer","/wiki/JASBUG","/wiki/Stagefright_(bug)","/wiki/DROWN_attack","/wiki/Badlock","/wiki/Dirty_COW","/wiki/Cloudbleed","/wiki/Broadcom#Vulnerabilities","/wiki/EternalBlue","/wiki/DoublePulsar","/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology#Silent_Bob_is_Silent","/wiki/KRACK","/wiki/ROCA_vulnerability","/wiki/BlueBorne_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Ransomware#Bad_Rabbit","/wiki/Careto_(malware)","/wiki/CryptoLocker","/wiki/Dexter_(malware)","/wiki/Duqu","/wiki/Duqu_2.0","/wiki/FinFisher","/wiki/Flame_(malware)","/wiki/Gameover_ZeuS","/wiki/Mahdi_(malware)","/wiki/Metulji_botnet","/wiki/Mirai_(malware)","/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog","/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club#Staatstrojaner_affair","/wiki/Shamoon","/wiki/Stars_virus","/wiki/Stuxnet","/wiki/Vault_7","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/X-Agent","/wiki/Disqus","/wiki/Disqus"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Disqus#October_2017_security_breach"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94df8c0262df3aa1b2f594"},"content":{"contents":["Anonymous\nis a loosely associated international network of activist and hacktivist\nentities. A website nominally associated with the group describes it as \"an Internet gathering\" with \"a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives\".[2]\n\nThe group became known for a series of well-publicized distributed denial-of-service\n(DDoS) attacks on government, religions, and corporate websites.[3]\n\n","Anonymous originated in 2003 on the imageboard\n4chan\n, representing the concept of many online and offline community users simultaneously existing as an anarchic\n, digitized global brain\n.[4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n\nAnonymous members (known as \"Anons\") can be distinguished in public by the wearing of Guy Fawkes masks\nin the style portrayed in the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta\n\n.[7]\n\nHowever this may not always be the case, as some of the collective prefer to instead cover their face without using the well-known mask as a disguise.","In its early form, the concept was adopted by a decentralized online community\nacting anonymously in a coordinated manner, usually toward a loosely self-agreed goal, and primarily focused on entertainment, or often referred to as \"lulz\n\". Beginning with 2008's Project Chanology\n—a series of protests, pranks, and hacks targeting the Church of Scientology\n—the Anonymous collective became increasingly associated with collaborative hacktivism on a number of issues internationally. Individuals claiming to align themselves with Anonymous undertook protests and other actions (including direct action) in retaliation against copyright-focused campaigns by motion picture and recording industry trade associations. Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government agencies of the U.S., Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n; child pornography sites; copyright protection agencies; the Westboro Baptist Church\n; and corporations such as PayPal\n, MasterCard\n, Visa\n, and Sony\n. Anons have publicly supported WikiLeaks\nand the Occupy movement\n. Related groups LulzSec\nand Operation AntiSec\ncarried out cyberattacks on U.S. government agencies, media, video game companies, military contractors, military personnel, and police officers, resulting in the attention of law enforcement to the groups' activities. Some actions by members of the group have been described as being anti-Zionist\n. It has threatened to cyber-attack Israel and engaged in the \"#OpIsrael\n\" cyber-attacks of Israeli websites on Yom HaShoah\n(Holocaust Remembrance Day) in 2013.[8]\n\n","Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks, in countries including the US, UK, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, India and Turkey. Evaluations of the group's actions and effectiveness vary widely. Supporters have called the group \"freedom fighters\"[9]\n\nand digital Robin Hoods\n[10]\n\nwhile critics have described them as \"a cyber lynch-mob\"[11]\n\nor \"cyber terrorists\".[12]\n\nIn 2012, Time\n\ncalled Anonymous one of the \"100 most influential people\n\" in the world.[13]\n\n","","","Long-standing political question that has gone unanswered with often tragic consequences for social movements. This is an Internet-based, non-extremist, socialist\ncommunity movement that looks for answers to questions that are unanswered.[14]\n\n","Internal dissent is also a regular feature of the group.[2]\n\nA website associated with the group describes it as \"an Internet gathering\" with \"a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives\".[2]\n\nGabriella Coleman\nwrites of the group, \"In some ways, it may be impossible to gauge the intent and motive of thousands of participants, many of who don't even bother to leave a trace of their thoughts, motivations, and reactions. Among those that do, opinions vary considerably.\"[15]\n\n","Broadly speaking, Anons oppose Internet censorship and control, and the majority of their actions target governments, organizations, and corporations that they accuse of censorship. Anons were early supporters of the global Occupy movement\nand the Arab Spring\n.[16]\n\nSince 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more serious (and, in some cases, political) activism.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n[17]\n\n","We [Anonymous] just happen to be a group of people on the Internet who need—just kind of an outlet to do as we wish, that we wouldn't be able to do in regular society. ...That's more or less the point of it. Do as you wish. ... There's a common phrase: 'we are doing it for the lulz.'","Because Anonymous has no leadership, no action can be attributed to the membership as a whole. Parmy Olson\nand others have criticized media coverage that presents the group as well-organized or homogeneous; Olson writes, \"There was no single leader pulling the levers, but a few organizational minds that sometimes pooled together to start planning a stunt.\"[19]\n\nSome members protest using legal means, while others employ illegal measures such as DDoS attacks and hacking.[20]\n\nMembership is open to anyone who wishes to state they are a member of the collective;[21]\n\nBritish journalist Carole Cadwalladr\nof The Observer\n\ncompared the group's decentralized structure to that of al-Qaeda\n: \"If you believe in Anonymous, and call yourself Anonymous, you are Anonymous.\"[22]\n\nOlson, who formerly described Anonymous as a \"brand\", stated in 2012 that she now characterized it as a \"movement\" rather than a group: \"anyone can be part of it. It is a crowd of people, a nebulous crowd of people, working together and doing things together for various purposes.\"[23]\n\n","The group's few rules include not disclosing one's identity, not talking about the group, and not attacking media.[24]\n\nMembers commonly use the tagline \"We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.\"[25]\n\nBrian Kelly writes that three of the group's key characteristics are \"(1) an unrelenting moral stance on issues and rights, regardless of direct provocation; (2) a physical presence that accompanies online hacking activity; and (3) a distinctive brand.\"[26]\n\n","Journalists have commented that Anonymous' secrecy, fabrications, and media awareness pose an unusual challenge for reporting on the group's actions and motivations.[27]\n\n[28]\n\nQuinn Norton\nof Wired\n\nwrites that \"Anons lie when they have no reason to lie. They weave vast fabrications as a form of performance. Then they tell the truth at unexpected and unfortunate times, sometimes destroying themselves in the process. They are unpredictable.\"[27]\n\nNorton states that the difficulties in reporting on the group cause most writers, including herself, to focus on the \"small groups of hackers who stole the limelight from a legion, defied their values, and crashed violently into the law\" rather than \"Anonymous’s sea of voices, all experimenting with new ways of being in the world\".[27]\n\n","The name Anonymous itself is inspired by the perceived anonymity under which users post images and comments on the Internet. Usage of the term Anonymous in the sense of a shared identity began on imageboards\n, particularly the /b/ board of 4chan\n, dedicated to random content. A tag of Anonymous is assigned to visitors who leave comments without identifying the originator of the posted content. Users of imageboards sometimes jokingly acted as if Anonymous was a single individual. The concept of the Anonymous entity advanced in 2004 when an administrator on the 4chan image board activated a \"Forced_Anon\" protocol that signed all posts as Anonymous.[30]\n\nAs the popularity of imageboards increased, the idea of Anonymous as a collective of unnamed individuals became an Internet meme\n.[31]\n\n","Users of 4chan's /b/ board would occasionally join into mass pranks or raids. In a raid on July 12, 2006, for example, large numbers of 4chan readers invaded the Finnish social networking site Habbo Hotel\nwith identical avatars; the avatars blocked regular Habbo members from accessing the digital hotel's pool, stating it was \"closed due to fail and AIDS\".[32]\n\nFuture LulzSec member Topiary\nbecame involved with the site at this time, inviting large audiences to listen to his prank phone calls via Skype\n.[33]\n\n[a]\n\nDue to the growing traffic on 4chan's boards, users soon began to plot pranks offline using Internet Relay Chat\n(IRC).[35]\n\nThese raids resulted in the first mainstream press story on Anonymous, a report by Fox\nstation KTTV\nin Los Angeles, California in the U.S. The report called the group \"hackers on steroids\", \"domestic terrorists\", and an \"Internet hate machine\".[29]\n\n[36]\n\n","Encyclopedia Dramatica was founded in 2004 by Sherrod DiGrippo, initially as a means of documenting gossip related to livejournal\n, but it quickly was adopted as a major platform by Anonymous for satirical and other purposes.[37]\n\nThe not safe for work\nsite celebrates a subversive\n\"trolling\nculture\", and documents Internet memes\n, culture\n, and events, such as mass pranks, trolling events, \"raids\", large-scale failures of Internet security, and criticism of Internet communities\nthat are accused of self-censorship\nin order to gain prestige or positive coverage from traditional and established media outlets\n. Journalist Julian Dibbell\ndescribed Encyclopædia Dramatica as the site \"where the vast parallel universe of Anonymous in-jokes, catchphrases, and obsessions is lovingly annotated, and you will discover an elaborate trolling culture: Flamingly racist and misogynist content lurks throughout, all of it calculated to offend.\"[37]\n\nThe site also played a role in the anti-Scientology\ncampaign of Project Chanology\n.[38]\n\n","On April 14, 2011, the original URL of the site was redirected to a new website named Oh Internet\nthat bore little resemblance to Encyclopedia Dramatica. Parts of the ED community harshly criticized the changes.[39]\n\nIn response, Anonymous launched \"Operation Save ED\" to rescue and restore the site's content.[40]\n\nThe Web Ecology Project made a downloadable archive of former Encyclopedia Dramatica content.[41]\n\n[42]\n\nThe site's reincarnation was initially hosted at encyclopediadramatica.ch on servers owned by Ryan Cleary, who later was arrested [43]\n\nin relation to attacks by LulzSec\nagainst Sony.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Anonymous first became associated with hacktivism\n[b]\n\nin 2008 following a series of actions against the Church of Scientology\nknown as Project Chanology. On January 15, 2008, the gossip blog Gawker\nposted a video in which celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise\npraised the religion;[44]\n\nand the Church responded with a cease-and-desist letter\nfor violation of copyright.[45]\n\n4chan users organized a raid against the Church in retaliation, prank-calling its hotline, sending black faxes\ndesigned to waste ink cartridges, and launching DDoS\nattacks against its websites.[46]\n\n[47]\n\n","The DDoS attacks were at first carried out with the Gigaloader\nand JMeter\napplications. Within a few days, these were supplanted by the Low Orbit Ion Cannon\n(LOIC), a network stress-testing application allowing users to flood a server with TCP\nor UDP\npackets. The LOIC soon became a signature weapon in the Anonymous arsenal; however, it would also lead to a number of arrests of less experienced Anons who failed to conceal their IP addresses\n.[48]\n\nSome operators in Anonymous IRC channels incorrectly told or lied to new volunteers that using the LOIC carried no legal risk.[49]\n\n[50]\n\n","During the DDoS attacks, a group of Anons uploaded a YouTube\nvideo in which a robotic voice speaks on behalf of Anonymous, telling the \"leaders of Scientology\" that \"For the good of your followers, for the good of mankind—for the laughs—we shall expel you from the Internet.\"[51]\n\n[52]\n\nWithin ten days, the video had attracted hundreds of thousands of views.[52]\n\n","On February 10, thousands of Anonymous joined simultaneous protests at Church of Scientology facilities around the world.[53]\n\nMany protesters wore the stylized Guy Fawkes masks\npopularized by the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta\n\n, in which an anarchist revolutionary battles a totalitarian government; the masks soon became a popular symbol for Anonymous.[54]\n\nIn-person protests against the Church continued throughout the year, including \"Operation Party Hard\" on March 15 and \"Operation Reconnect\" on April 12.[55]\n\n[56]\n\n[57]\n\nHowever, by mid-year, they were drawing far fewer protesters, and many of the organizers in IRC channels had begun to drift away from the project.[58]\n\n","By the start of 2009, Scientologists had stopped engaging with protesters and had improved online security, and actions against the group had largely ceased. A period of infighting followed between the politically engaged members (called \"moralfags\" in the parlance of 4chan) and those seeking to provoke for entertainment (trolls).[59]\n\nBy September 2010, the group had received little publicity for a year and faced a corresponding drop in member interest; its raids diminished greatly in size and moved largely off of IRC channels, organizing again from the chan boards, particularly /b/.[60]\n\n","In September 2010, however, Anons became aware of Aiplex Software\n, an Indian software company that contracted with film studios to launch DDoS attacks on websites used by copyright infringers, such as The Pirate Bay\n.[61]\n\n[60]\n\nCoordinating through IRC, Anons launched a DDoS attack on September 17 that shut down Aiplex's website for a day. Primarily using LOIC, the group then targeted the Recording Industry Association of America\n(RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America\n(MPAA), successfully bringing down both sites.[62]\n\nOn September 19, future LulzSec member Mustafa Al-Bassam (known as \"Tflow\") and other Anons hacked the website of Copyright Alliance, an anti-infringement group, and posted the name of the operation: \"Payback Is A Bitch\", or \"Operation Payback\" for short.[63]\n\nAnons also issued a press release, stating:","Anonymous is tired of corporate interests controlling the internet and silencing the people’s rights to spread information, but more importantly, the right to SHARE with one another. The RIAA and the MPAA feign to aid the artists and their cause; yet they do no such thing. In their eyes is not hope, only dollar signs. Anonymous will not stand this any longer.[64]\n\n","As IRC network operators were beginning to shut down networks involved in DDoS attacks, Anons organized a group of servers to host an independent IRC network, titled AnonOps.[65]\n\nOperation Payback's targets rapidly expanded to include the British law firm ACS:Law\n,[66]\n\nthe Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft\n,[67]\n\nthe British nightclub Ministry of Sound\n,[68]\n\nthe Spanish copyright society Sociedad General de Autores y Editores\n,[69]\n\nthe U.S. Copyright Office\n,[70]\n\nand the website of Gene Simmons\nof Kiss\n.[71]\n\nBy October 7, 2010, total downtime for all websites attacked during Operation Payback was 537.55 hours.[71]\n\n","In November 2010, the organization WikiLeaks\nbegan releasing hundreds of thousands of leaked U.S. diplomatic cables\n. In the face of legal threats against the organization by the U.S. government, Amazon.com\nbooted WikiLeaks from its servers, and PayPal\n, MasterCard\n, and Visa\ncut off service to the organization.[72]\n\nOperation Payback then expanded to include \"Operation Avenge Assange\n\", and Anons issued a press release declaring PayPal a target.[73]\n\nLaunching DDoS attacks with the LOIC, Anons quickly brought down the websites of the PayPal blog; PostFinance\n, a Swiss financial company denying service to WikiLeaks; EveryDNS\n, a web-hosting company that had also denied service; and the website of U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman\n, who had supported the push to cut off services.[74]\n\n","On December 8, Anons launched an attack against PayPal's main site. According to Topiary, who was in the command channel during the attack, the LOIC proved ineffective, and Anons were forced to rely on the botnets\nof two hackers for the attack, marshaling hijacked computers for a concentrated assault.[75]\n\nSecurity researcher Sean-Paul Correll also reported that the \"zombie computers\" of involuntary botnets had provided 90% of the attack.[76]\n\nTopiary states that he and other Anons then \"lied a bit to the press to give it that sense of abundance\", exaggerating the role of the grassroots membership. However, this account was disputed.[77]\n\n","The attacks brought down PayPal.com for an hour on December 8 and another brief period on December 9.[78]\n\nAnonymous also disrupted the sites for Visa and MasterCard on December 8.[79]\n\nAnons had announced an intention to bring down Amazon.com as well, but failed to do so, allegedly because of infighting with the hackers who controlled the botnets.[80]\n\nPayPal estimated the damage to have cost the company US$5.5 million. It later provided the IP addresses of 1,000 of its attackers to the FBI\n, leading to at least 14 arrests.[81]\n\nOn Thursday, December 5, 2013, 13 of the PayPal 14\npleaded guilty to taking part in the attacks.[82]\n\n","In the years following Operation Payback, targets of Anonymous protests, hacks, and DDoS attacks continued to diversify. Beginning in January 2011, Anons took a number of actions known initially as Operation Tunisia\nin support of Arab Spring\nmovements.

Anonymous\nseeks mass awareness and revolution against what the organization perceives as corrupt entities, while attempting to maintain anonymity\n. Anonymous has had a hacktivist impact.[2]\n\nThis is a timeline of activities reported to be carried out by the group.","According to white supremacist radio host Hal Turner, in December 2006 and January 2007 individuals who identified themselves as Anonymous took Turner's website offline, costing him thousands of dollars in bandwidth\nbills. As a result, Turner sued 4chan\n, \u003e, 7chan, and other websites for copyright infringement\n. He lost his plea for an injunction, however, and failed to receive letters from the court, which caused the lawsuit to lapse.[3]\n\n\nChris Forcand arrest\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nOn December 7, 2007, the Canada-based Toronto Sun\n\nnewspaper published a report on the arrest of the alleged Internet predator Chris Forcand.[4]\n\nForcand, 53, was charged with two counts of luring a child under the age of 14, attempt to invite sexual touching, attempted exposure, possessing a dangerous weapon, and carrying a concealed weapon.[5]\n\nThe report stated that Forcand was already being tracked by \"cyber-vigilantes\nwho seek to out anyone who presents with a sexual interest in children\" before police investigations commenced.[4]\n\n\nThe Global Television Network\nreport identified the group responsible for Forcand's arrest as a \"self-described Internet vigilante group called Anonymous\" who contacted the police after some members were \"propositioned\" by Forcand with \"disgusting photos of himself\". The report also stated that this is the first time a suspected Internet predator was arrested by the police as a result of Internet vigilantism\n.[6]\n\n\n2008\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nProject Chanology\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nMain article: Project Chanology\n\n\nPlay media\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Message to Scientology\", January 21, 2008\n\n\nThe group gained worldwide press for Project Chanology, the protest against the Church of Scientology\n.[7]\n\n\nOn January 14, 2008, a video produced by the Church featuring an interview with Tom Cruise\nwas leaked to the Internet and uploaded to YouTube.[8]\n\n[9]\n\n[10]\n\nThe Church of Scientology issued a copyright violation claim against YouTube requesting the removal of the video.[11]\n\nIn response to this, Anonymous formulated Project Chanology.[12]\n\n[13]\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\nCalling the action by the Church of Scientology a form of Internet censorship\n, members of Project Chanology organized a series of denial-of-service attacks\nagainst Scientology websites, prank calls\n, and black faxes\nto Scientology centers.[16]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtest by Anonymous against the practices and tax status of the Church of Scientology\n.\n\n\nOn January 21, 2008, individuals claiming to speak for Anonymous announced their goals and intentions via a video posted to YouTube entitled \"Message to Scientology\" and a press release\ndeclaring a \"War on Scientology\" against both the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center\n.[15]\n\n[17]\n\n[18]\n\nIn the press release, the group states that the attacks against the Church of Scientology will continue in order to protect the right to freedom of speech\nand end what they believe to be the financial exploitation of church members.[19]\n\nA new video \"Call to Action\" appeared on YouTube on January 28, 2008, calling for protests outside Church of Scientology centers on February 10, 2008.[20]\n\n[21]\n\nOn February 2, 2008, 150 people gathered outside of a Church of Scientology center in Orlando, Florida\nto protest the organization's practices.[22]\n\n[23]\n\n[24]\n\n[25]\n\nSmall protests were also held in Santa Barbara, California\n,[26]\n\nand Manchester, England\n.[23]\n\n[27]\n\nOn February 10, 2008, about 7000 people protested in more than 93 cities worldwide\n.[28]\n\n[29]\n\nMany protesters wore masks\nbased on the character V\nfrom V for Vendetta\n\n(who, in turn, had been influenced by Guy Fawkes\n), or otherwise disguised their identities, in part to protect themselves from reprisals from the Church\n.[30]\n\n[31]\n\n\nAnonymous held a second wave of protests\non March 15, 2008 in cities all over the world, including Boston, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Vancouver, Toronto, Berlin, and Dublin. The global turnout was estimated to be \"between 7000 and 8000\", a number similar to that of the first wave.[32]\n\nThe third wave of protests took place on April 12, 2008.[33]\n\n[34]\n\nNamed \"Operation Reconnect\", it aimed to increase awareness of the Church of Scientology's disconnection policy\n.[8]\n\n\nOn October 17, 2008, an 18-year-old from New Jersey described himself as a member of Anonymous, and he stated that he would plead guilty to involvement in the January 2008 DDoS attacks against Church of Scientology websites.[35]\n\n\nProtests continued, taking advantage of media events such as the premiere of the Tom Cruise movie Valkyrie\n\n, where the venue was chosen in part to reduce exposure to the protests.[36]\n\n\nEpilepsy Foundation forum invasion\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nMain article: Epilepsy Foundation: 2008 forum invasion\n\nOn March 28, 2008, Wired News\n\nreported that \"Internet griefers\n\"—a slang term for people whose only interests are in harassing others[37]\n\n—assaulted an epilepsy\nsupport forum run by the Epilepsy Foundation of America\n.[38]\n\nJavaScript\ncode and flashing computer animations were posted with the intention of triggering migraine\nheadaches and seizures\nin photosensitive and pattern-sensitive epileptics\n.[38]\n\nAccording to Wired News\n, circumstantial evidence suggested that the attack was perpetrated by Anonymous users, with the initial attack posts on the epilepsy forum blaming World\"\u003eeBaum's World\n. Members of the epilepsy forum claimed they had found a thread in which the attack was being planned at 4chan.org, an imageboard\nthat has been described as a stronghold for Anonymous. The thread, like all old threads eventually do on these types of imageboards, has since cycled to deletion.[38]\n\n\nNews.com.au\n\nreported that the administrators of 4chan.org had posted an open letter claiming that the attacks had been carried out by the Church of Scientology \"to ruin the public opinion of Anonymous, to lessen the effect of the lawful protests against their virulent organization\" under the Church's fair game\npolicy.[37]\n\n\nDefacement of SOHH and AllHipHop websites\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nMain article: SOHH: Defacement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second in a series of five defaced SOHH banners and headline feeders, vandalized by hackers.\n\n\nIn late June 2008, users who identified themselves as Anonymous claimed responsibility for a series of attacks against the SOHH\n(Support Online Hip Hop) website.[39]\n\nThe attack was reported to have begun in retaliation for insults made by members of SOHH's \"Just Bugging Out\" forum against members of Anonymous. The attack against the website took place in stages, as Anonymous users flooded the SOHH forums, which were then shut down. On June 23, 2008, the group which identified themselves as Anonymous organized DDoS\nattacks against the website, successfully eliminating 60% of the website's service capacity. On June 27, 2008, the hackers utilized cross-site scripting\nto deface the website's main page with satirical Nazi images and headlines referencing numerous racial stereotypes and slurs, and also successfully stole information from SOHH employees.[40]\n\nFollowing the defacement, the website was temporarily shut down by its administration. AllHipHop\n, an unrelated website, also had its forum raided.[39]\n\n\nSarah Palin email hack\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nShortly after midnight on September 16, 2008, the private Yahoo! Mail\naccount of Sarah Palin\nwas hacked by a 4chan\nuser.[41]\n\nThe hacker, known as \"Rubico\", claimed he had read Palin's personal e-mails because he was looking for something that \"would derail her campaign\".[42]\n\nAfter reading through Palin's emails, Rubico wrote, \"There was nothing there, nothing incriminating — all I saw was personal stuff, some clerical stuff from when she was governor.\"[42]\n\nRubico wrote that he used the Sarah Palin Wikipedia\narticle to find Palin's birth date (one of the standard security questions\nused by Yahoo!.[43]\n\n) in \"15 seconds\". The hacker posted the account's password on /b/\n, an image board on 4chan\n, and screenshots\nfrom within the account to WikiLeaks\n.[44]\n\nA /b/ user then logged in and changed the password, posting a screenshot of his sending an email to a friend of Palin's informing her of the new password on the /b/ thread. However, he did not blank out the password in the screenshot.[45]\n\nA multitude of /b/ users then attempted to log in with the new password, and the account was automatically locked out by Yahoo!. The incident was criticized by some /b/ users, one of whom complained that \"seriously, /b/. We could have changed history and failed, epically.\"[46]\n\n\n2009\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nNo Cussing Club\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn January 2009, members of Anonymous targeted South Pasadena, California\nteen McKay Hatch who runs the No Cussing Club, a website against profanity\n.[47]\n\n[48]\n\nAs Hatch's home address\n, phone number, and other personal information were leaked on the internet, his family has received hate mail\n, obscene phone calls\n, and bogus pizza\nand pornography deliveries.[49]\n\n\n2009 Iranian election protests\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront page of The Pirate Bay\n, June 20, 2009. Anonymous, together with The Pirate Bay, launched an Iranian Green Movement\nSupport site.[50]\n\n\n\n\nMain article: 2009 Iranian election protests\n\nFollowing allegations of vote rigging after the results of the June 2009 Iranian presidential election\nwere announced, declaring Iran\n's incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\nas the winner, thousands of Iranians participated in demonstrations\n. Anonymous, together with The Pirate Bay\nand various Iranian hackers, launched an Iranian Green Movement\nSupport site called Anonymous Iran.[50]\n\nThe site has drawn over 22,000 supporters worldwide and allows for information exchange between the world and Iran, despite attempts by the Iranian government\nto censor news about the riots on the internet\n. The site provides resources and support to Iranians who are protesting.[51]\n\n[52]\n\n\nOperation Didgeridie\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nMain article: Internet censorship in Australia\n\nIn September 2009, the group reawakened \"in order to protect civil rights\" after several governments began to block access to its imageboards. The blacklisting\nof Krautchan.net in Germany infuriated many, but the tipping point was the Australian government's plans for ISP-level censorship of the internet. The policy was spearheaded by Stephen Conroy\nand had been driven aggressively[53]\n\nby the Rudd Government\nsince its election in 2007.\nEarly in the evening of September 9, Anonymous took down the prime minister's website with a distributed denial-of-service\nattack. The site was taken offline for approximately one hour.[54]\n\n\n2010\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nOperation Titstorm\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nMain article: February 2010 Australian Cyberattacks\n\nExternal video\n\nMessage To The Australian Government From Anonymous\n,[55]\n\ndirected at Kevin Rudd\nand Seven News\nhours before Operation Titstorm began.[56]\n\n\n\n\nOccurred from 8\u0026#160;am, February 10, 2010 as a protest against the Australian Government over the forthcoming internet filtering legislation and the perceived censorship in pornography of small-breasted women (who are perceived to be under age) and female ejaculation. Hours earlier, Anonymous uploaded a video message to YouTube, addressed to Kevin Rudd\n, and Seven News\n, presenting a list of demands and threats of further action if they were not met.[56]\n\nThe protest consisted of a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) on Australian Government websites. Australian anti-censorship groups complained that the attack only hurt their cause, and Australian government members dismissed the attack and said that they would just restore the service when the attack finished.[57]\n\n[58]\n\nAnalysis of the attacks cited their peak bandwidth at under 17Mbit, a figure considered small when compared with other DDoS attacks.[59]\n\n\nOregon Tea Party raid\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nIn July 2010, there was a reaction to the use of one of Anonymous' slogans by the Oregon Tea Party\n. The Party's Facebook page was flooded with image macro\nand flames. Within a few hours, the Tea Party posted a message saying \"Anonymous: We appreciate your resources and admire your tactics. You have taught us more than you know. As requested, we are no longer using the 'anonymous' quote.\" Following this raid, the Party's Facebook page was removed, and its Ning\npage limited to member-only access.[60]\n\n\n\nOperations Payback, Avenge Assange, and Bradical\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous releases their fliers\nand press releases\nto the public domain\n.\n\n\nMain article: Operation Payback\n\nIn 2010, several Bollywood\ncompanies hired Aiplex Software\nto launch DDoS attacks on websites that did not respond to software takedown notices\n.[61]\n\nFile sharing activists then created Operation Payback in September 2010 in retaliation.[61]\n\nThe original plan was to attack Aiplex Software directly, but upon finding some hours before the planned DDoS that another individual had taken down the firm's website on their own, Operation Payback moved to launching attacks against the websites of copyright stringent organizations, law firms\nand other websites.[62]\n\nThis grew into multiple DDoS attacks against anti-piracy groups and law firms.\nOn April 2, 2011, Anonymous launched an attack on the media giant Sony, named #opsony, as a part of Operation Payback.[63]\n\nAnonymous claims the attack a success after they took down the PlayStation Network and other related PlayStation Websites. Anonymous' actions also included personal harassment of employees and their families. The PlayStation Network subsequently has had lengthy outages, although Anonymous claims that this is not due to any officially sanctioned action on their part, but may be due to sub-groups of Anonymous.[64]\n\n\nSony Corp. came to Anonymous' attention after it took legal action\nagainst George Hotz\n(a.k.a. GeoHot), the coder behind a popular tool that allows homebrew software to run on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). Sony is also taking legal action against Alexander Egorenkov (aka Graf_Chokolo) for his efforts to restore Linux to the PS3. The reason why Hotz and Egorenkov did that follows on from Sony's decision to remove the system's OtherOS feature, which enabled the use of Linux. While the pair has earned respect for their research and technical skills, they have also gained the attention of Sony's legal team. With a lawsuit now against Hotz this attracted the attention of Anonymous. They claim that Sony is breaching the free speech border, and this is the reason for their actions.[65]\n\n\nIn December 2010, the document archive website WikiLeaks\n(used by whistleblowers\n) came under intense pressure to stop publishing secret United States diplomatic cables\n. In response, Anonymous announced its support for WikiLeaks,[66]\n\n[67]\n\nand Operation Payback changed its focus to support WikiLeaks and launched DDoS attacks against Amazon\n, PayPal\n, MasterCard\n, Visa\nand the Swiss bank PostFinance, in retaliation for perceived anti-WikiLeaks behavior.

In retaliation for Aaron Barr's claims, members of the group Anonymous hacked the website of HBGary Federal and replaced the welcome page with a message stating that Anonymous should not be messed with, and that the hacking of the website was necessary to defend itself. Using a variety of techniques, including social engineering\nand SQL injection\n,[106]\n\nAnonymous also went on to take control of the company's e-mail, dumping 68,000 e-mails from the system, erasing files, and taking down their phone system.[107]\n\nThe leaked emails revealed the reports and company presentations of other companies in computer security such as Endgame systems\nwho promise high quality offensive software, advertising \"subscriptions of $2,500,000 per year for access to 0day exploits\n\".[108]\n\n\nAmong the documents exposed was a PowerPoint\npresentation entitled \"The Wikileaks Threat\", put together by HBGary Federal along with two other data intelligence firms for Bank of America in December.[109]\n\nWithin the report, these firms created a list of important contributors to WikiLeaks; they further developed a strategic plan of attack against the site.

The raid was separated in multiple teams: The first team, the Alpha Team, spammed “horrifying” images of child pornography, gore, furries and scat on 9gag's site, followed by fake accounts made by 4chan, Anonymous, Reddit, Twitter and Funnyjunk voting the spam up, effectively overloading the servers. The second team, the Gold Team, used the Low Orbit Ion Cannon\nand the High Orbit Ion Cannon\n(LOIC and HOIC, respectively), and fired on 9gag, which DDoS'd the entire site down. The third team, the Red Team, was tasked to spread the information of the OP on 4chan, Reddit, Twitter and Funnyjunk, and also supported the other teams. The fourth and final team, the White Team, was tasked with spamming chat sites such as Omegle and Chatroulette with inappropriate messages, such as “9gag.com is the place for Child Pornography!”, in order to tarnish 9gag's \"wholesome\" and \"family-friendly” name. The reason behind this whole operation began when 9gag took several of 4chan's memes and called them theirs, followed by making a legion called the '9gag army', a ripoff of Anonymous. The operation began on December 21, 2011 at 12:00\u0026#160;AM, and ended at 11:59\u0026#160;PM. 9gag was mainly offline for the next few days, except for some servers which managed to protect themselves from the LOIC and HOIC. Prior to the operation, 4chan users used fake accounts to trick 9gaggers into DDoS'ing themselves, saying the coordinates were that of 4chan.

The attack affected 22 websites for the entire duration and it was carried out by someone with the username Anon3_ saying \"it was done as a showing of strength and to show the world the brotherhood that Anonymous has\"\n\nOperation StormFront\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2015, Anonymous posted a video claiming that due to \"Racism, Antisemitism, Islamophobia and Holocaust Denial\" they were going to attack the website Stormfront\n.[336]\n\nThis website is a white-supremacist website run by former KKK Leader Don Black\n. The attack was planned for August 1, 2015. [337]\n\n\n\nOperation KKK (OPKKK)\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nOperation KKK says it has identifying data on as many as 1,000 KKK\nmembers and supporters. On Oct. 22, 2015, an Anonymous-associated Twitter account announced that the hacking collective had accessed a Klan-associated Twitter account and promised that they would expose about 1,000 Klan members by name. A later news release promised that the operation would release “names and Web sites, new and old” of “more than 1000″ members of the hate group.\nPreviously, Anonymous waged a campaign against a Missouri-based Klan organization last year after the group threatened to use “lethal force” in defense of themselves against protests in Ferguson, Mo., over the shooting death of Michael Brown. At the time, Anonymous unleashed a smaller doxx against members of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and also took over a Klan-run Twitter account.\n2016\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nOperation Comelec\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nMain article: Commission on Elections data breach\n\nAnonymous Philippines hacked the Commission on Elections\n(COMELEC) website to force them to add security to vote count machines (VCMs). The hacking was followed by a voters' personal information leak,[338]\n\nled by LulzSec\nPilipinas,[339]\n\nwho placed them in the website \"wehaveyourdata.com\". Paul Biteng, a 20-year old information technology\n(IT) graduate and one of the hackers of the COMELEC, website was soon arrested by National Bureau of Investigation\n(NBI) agents.[340]\n\n\nOperation Single Gateway\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nAfter the failure of its single gateway system, the Thai government proposed amendments to the existing Computer Crime Act in May 2016, which they approved on December 16. Anonymous declared cyberwar on Thailand after the passing of these amendments.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nThe amendments allowed the government to censor websites and intercept private communications without a court order or warrant. Anonymous started a Facebook group called \"citizens against single gateway\" to protest against these acts.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nOther anonymous members DDoSed several Thailand government websites. One of these F5-powered DDoS attacks hit Thailand's defense website on December 19. It was later revealed that hackers also breached the Thai Police Office website on December 17. The website of the Tourism and Sports was also targeted and attacked on December 23.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nSeveral Thai citizens who were part of anonymous ranging from ages 17–20 were arrested.\n2017\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nOperation Darknet Relaunch\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nVisitors to more than 10,000 Tor-based websites were met with an alarming announcement on February 3, 11:50 AM EST: \"Hello, Freedom Hosting II, you have been hacked.\" A group affiliating itself with Anonymous had compromised servers at Freedom Hosting II, a popular service for hosting websites accessible only through Tor.\nThe Anonymous hacktivists claimed over 50% of the data stored on the Freedom Hosting II servers contained child pornography. International Business Times\nreported that the hackers stole 75 GB worth of files and 2.6 GB of databases.[341]\n\n\nAccording to Sarah Jamie Lewis, an independent anonymity and privacy researcher who spotted the mass hack as part of her regular scans of the Onion space (Dark Web sites running on the Tor network), Freedom Hosting II was hosting an estimated 20% of all websites on the Dark Web.[342]\n\n\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nAnonymous (group)#History\n\n2016 Dyn cyberattack\n\nbusabos\n\n\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n^\n\n\nHalupka.

The report also stated that this is the first time a suspected Internet predator was arrested by the police as a result of Internet vigilantism\n.[6]\n\n","The group gained worldwide press for Project Chanology, the protest against the Church of Scientology\n.[7]\n\n","On January 14, 2008, a video produced by the Church featuring an interview with Tom Cruise\nwas leaked to the Internet and uploaded to YouTube.[8]\n\n[9]\n\n[10]\n\nThe Church of Scientology issued a copyright violation claim against YouTube requesting the removal of the video.[11]\n\nIn response to this, Anonymous formulated Project Chanology.[12]\n\n[13]\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\nCalling the action by the Church of Scientology a form of Internet censorship\n, members of Project Chanology organized a series of denial-of-service attacks\nagainst Scientology websites, prank calls\n, and black faxes\nto Scientology centers.[16]\n\n","On January 21, 2008, individuals claiming to speak for Anonymous announced their goals and intentions via a video posted to YouTube entitled \"Message to Scientology\" and a press release\ndeclaring a \"War on Scientology\" against both the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center\n.[15]\n\n[17]\n\n[18]\n\nIn the press release, the group states that the attacks against the Church of Scientology will continue in order to protect the right to freedom of speech\nand end what they believe to be the financial exploitation of church members.[19]\n\nA new video \"Call to Action\" appeared on YouTube on January 28, 2008, calling for protests outside Church of Scientology centers on February 10, 2008.[20]\n\n[21]\n\nOn February 2, 2008, 150 people gathered outside of a Church of Scientology center in Orlando, Florida\nto protest the organization's practices.[22]\n\n[23]\n\n[24]\n\n[25]\n\nSmall protests were also held in Santa Barbara, California\n,[26]\n\nand Manchester, England\n.[23]\n\n[27]\n\nOn February 10, 2008, about 7000 people protested in more than 93 cities worldwide\n.[28]\n\n[29]\n\nMany protesters wore masks\nbased on the character V\nfrom V for Vendetta\n\n(who, in turn, had been influenced by Guy Fawkes\n), or otherwise disguised their identities, in part to protect themselves from reprisals from the Church\n.[30]\n\n[31]\n\n","Anonymous held a second wave of protests\non March 15, 2008 in cities all over the world, including Boston, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Vancouver, Toronto, Berlin, and Dublin. The global turnout was estimated to be \"between 7000 and 8000\", a number similar to that of the first wave.[32]\n\nThe third wave of protests took place on April 12, 2008.[33]\n\n[34]\n\nNamed \"Operation Reconnect\", it aimed to increase awareness of the Church of Scientology's disconnection policy\n.[8]\n\n","On October 17, 2008, an 18-year-old from New Jersey described himself as a member of Anonymous, and he stated that he would plead guilty to involvement in the January 2008 DDoS attacks against Church of Scientology websites.[35]\n\n","Protests continued, taking advantage of media events such as the premiere of the Tom Cruise movie Valkyrie\n\n, where the venue was chosen in part to reduce exposure to the protests.[36]\n\n","On March 28, 2008, Wired News\n\nreported that \"Internet griefers\n\"—a slang term for people whose only interests are in harassing others[37]\n\n—assaulted an epilepsy\nsupport forum run by the Epilepsy Foundation of America\n.[38]\n\nJavaScript\ncode and flashing computer animations were posted with the intention of triggering migraine\nheadaches and seizures\nin photosensitive and pattern-sensitive epileptics\n.[38]\n\nAccording to Wired News\n, circumstantial evidence suggested that the attack was perpetrated by Anonymous users, with the initial attack posts on the epilepsy forum blaming World\"\u003eeBaum's World\n. Members of the epilepsy forum claimed they had found a thread in which the attack was being planned at 4chan.org, an imageboard\nthat has been described as a stronghold for Anonymous. The thread, like all old threads eventually do on these types of imageboards, has since cycled to deletion.[38]\n\n","News.com.au\n\nreported that the administrators of 4chan.org had posted an open letter claiming that the attacks had been carried out by the Church of Scientology \"to ruin the public opinion of Anonymous, to lessen the effect of the lawful protests against their virulent organization\" under the Church's fair game\npolicy.[37]\n\n","In late June 2008, users who identified themselves as Anonymous claimed responsibility for a series of attacks against the SOHH\n(Support Online Hip Hop) website.[39]\n\nThe attack was reported to have begun in retaliation for insults made by members of SOHH's \"Just Bugging Out\" forum against members of Anonymous. The attack against the website took place in stages, as Anonymous users flooded the SOHH forums, which were then shut down. On June 23, 2008, the group which identified themselves as Anonymous organized DDoS\nattacks against the website, successfully eliminating 60% of the website's service capacity. On June 27, 2008, the hackers utilized cross-site scripting\nto deface the website's main page with satirical Nazi images and headlines referencing numerous racial stereotypes and slurs, and also successfully stole information from SOHH employees.[40]\n\nFollowing the defacement, the website was temporarily shut down by its administration. AllHipHop\n, an unrelated website, also had its forum raided.[39]\n\n","Shortly after midnight on September 16, 2008, the private Yahoo! Mail\naccount of Sarah Palin\nwas hacked by a 4chan\nuser.[41]\n\nThe hacker, known as \"Rubico\", claimed he had read Palin's personal e-mails because he was looking for something that \"would derail her campaign\".[42]\n\nAfter reading through Palin's emails, Rubico wrote, \"There was nothing there, nothing incriminating — all I saw was personal stuff, some clerical stuff from when she was governor.\"[42]\n\nRubico wrote that he used the Sarah Palin Wikipedia\narticle to find Palin's birth date (one of the standard security questions\nused by Yahoo!.[43]\n\n) in \"15 seconds\". The hacker posted the account's password on /b/\n, an image board on 4chan\n, and screenshots\nfrom within the account to WikiLeaks\n.[44]\n\nA /b/ user then logged in and changed the password, posting a screenshot of his sending an email to a friend of Palin's informing her of the new password on the /b/ thread. However, he did not blank out the password in the screenshot.[45]\n\nA multitude of /b/ users then attempted to log in with the new password, and the account was automatically locked out by Yahoo!. The incident was criticized by some /b/ users, one of whom complained that \"seriously, /b/. We could have changed history and failed, epically.\"[46]\n\n","In January 2009, members of Anonymous targeted South Pasadena, California\nteen McKay Hatch who runs the No Cussing Club, a website against profanity\n.[47]\n\n[48]\n\nAs Hatch's home address\n, phone number, and other personal information were leaked on the internet, his family has received hate mail\n, obscene phone calls\n, and bogus pizza\nand pornography deliveries.[49]\n\n","Following allegations of vote rigging after the results of the June 2009 Iranian presidential election\nwere announced, declaring Iran\n's incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\nas the winner, thousands of Iranians participated in demonstrations\n. Anonymous, together with The Pirate Bay\nand various Iranian hackers, launched an Iranian Green Movement\nSupport site called Anonymous Iran.[50]\n\nThe site has drawn over 22,000 supporters worldwide and allows for information exchange between the world and Iran, despite attempts by the Iranian government\nto censor news about the riots on the internet\n. The site provides resources and support to Iranians who are protesting.[51]\n\n[52]\n\n","In September 2009, the group reawakened \"in order to protect civil rights\" after several governments began to block access to its imageboards. The blacklisting\nof Krautchan.net in Germany infuriated many, but the tipping point was the Australian government's plans for ISP-level censorship of the internet. The policy was spearheaded by Stephen Conroy\nand had been driven aggressively[53]\n\nby the Rudd Government\nsince its election in 2007.","Early in the evening of September 9, Anonymous took down the prime minister's website with a distributed denial-of-service\nattack. The site was taken offline for approximately one hour.[54]\n\n","Occurred from 8\u0026#160;am, February 10, 2010 as a protest against the Australian Government over the forthcoming internet filtering legislation and the perceived censorship in pornography of small-breasted women (who are perceived to be under age) and female ejaculation. Hours earlier, Anonymous uploaded a video message to YouTube, addressed to Kevin Rudd\n, and Seven News\n, presenting a list of demands and threats of further action if they were not met.[56]\n\nThe protest consisted of a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) on Australian Government websites. Australian anti-censorship groups complained that the attack only hurt their cause, and Australian government members dismissed the attack and said that they would just restore the service when the attack finished.[57]\n\n[58]\n\nAnalysis of the attacks cited their peak bandwidth at under 17Mbit, a figure considered small when compared with other DDoS attacks.[59]\n\n","In July 2010, there was a reaction to the use of one of Anonymous' slogans by the Oregon Tea Party\n. The Party's Facebook page was flooded with image macro\nand flames. Within a few hours, the Tea Party posted a message saying \"Anonymous: We appreciate your resources and admire your tactics. You have taught us more than you know. As requested, we are no longer using the 'anonymous' quote.\" Following this raid, the Party's Facebook page was removed, and its Ning\npage limited to member-only access.[60]\n\n","In 2010, several Bollywood\ncompanies hired Aiplex Software\nto launch DDoS attacks on websites that did not respond to software takedown notices\n.[61]\n\nFile sharing activists then created Operation Payback in September 2010 in retaliation.[61]\n\nThe original plan was to attack Aiplex Software directly, but upon finding some hours before the planned DDoS that another individual had taken down the firm's website on their own, Operation Payback moved to launching attacks against the websites of copyright stringent organizations, law firms\nand other websites.[62]\n\nThis grew into multiple DDoS attacks against anti-piracy groups and law firms.","On April 2, 2011, Anonymous launched an attack on the media giant Sony, named #opsony, as a part of Operation Payback.[63]\n\nAnonymous claims the attack a success after they took down the PlayStation Network and other related PlayStation Websites. Anonymous' actions also included personal harassment of employees and their families. The PlayStation Network subsequently has had lengthy outages, although Anonymous claims that this is not due to any officially sanctioned action on their part, but may be due to sub-groups of Anonymous.[64]\n\n","Sony Corp. came to Anonymous' attention after it took legal action\nagainst George Hotz\n(a.k.a. GeoHot), the coder behind a popular tool that allows homebrew software to run on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). Sony is also taking legal action against Alexander Egorenkov (aka Graf_Chokolo) for his efforts to restore Linux to the PS3. The reason why Hotz and Egorenkov did that follows on from Sony's decision to remove the system's OtherOS feature, which enabled the use of Linux. While the pair has earned respect for their research and technical skills, they have also gained the attention of Sony's legal team. With a lawsuit now against Hotz this attracted the attention of Anonymous. They claim that Sony is breaching the free speech border, and this is the reason for their actions.[65]\n\n","In December 2010, the document archive website WikiLeaks\n(used by whistleblowers\n) came under intense pressure to stop publishing secret United States diplomatic cables\n. In response, Anonymous announced its support for WikiLeaks,[66]\n\n[67]\n\nand Operation Payback changed its focus to support WikiLeaks and launched DDoS attacks against Amazon\n, PayPal\n, MasterCard\n, Visa\nand the Swiss bank PostFinance, in retaliation for perceived anti-WikiLeaks behavior. This second front in the December offensive was performed under the codename Operation Avenge Assange.[68]\n\n[69]\n\n[70]\n\n[71]\n\n[72]\n\n[73]\n\nDue to the attacks, both MasterCard and Visa's websites were brought down on December 8.[74]\n\n[75]\n\nA threat researcher at PandaLabs said Anonymous also launched an attack which brought down the Swedish prosecutor's website when WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\nwas arrested in London and refused bail in relation to extradition to Sweden.[76]\n\n","After suspected leaker Chelsea Manning\nwas transferred to Marine Corps Brig, Quantico\nin July 2010, allegations of abuse arose around Manning's isolation in a maximum security area, and the suicide-watch she was put under which included constant verbal checks by guards and forced nudity.[77]\n\n[78]\n\n[79]\n\n[80]\n\n[81]\n\nMilitary officials denied the treatment was abuse or abnormal. In an event that led to his resignation, State Department spokesman\nPhilip J.

The Dutch AIVD\ndeduced from security camera footage that it is led by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service\n(SVR).[3]\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike\nalso previously suggested that it may be associated with either the Russian Federal Security Service\n(FSB) or SVR.[2]\n\nThe group was given other nicknames by other cybersecurity firms, including Office Monkeys\n, CozyCar\n,[4]\n\nThe Dukes\n(by Volexity), and CozyDuke\n[5]\n\n[6]\n\n(by F-Secure\n).","","","Kaspersky Lab determined that the earliest samples of Miniduke are from 2008.[1]\n\nThe original Miniduke malware was written in assembler\n.[7]\n\nSymantec believes that Cozy Bear had been compromising diplomatic organizations and governments since at least 2010.[8]\n\nCozy Bear appears to have different projects, with different user groups. The focus of its project \"Nemesis Gemina\" is military, government, energy, diplomatic and telecom sectors.[7]\n\n","The CozyDuke malware utilises a backdoor\nand a dropper\n. The malware exfiltrates data to a command and control server. Attackers may tailor the malware to the environment.[1]\n\nThe backdoor components of Cozy Bear's malware are updated over time with modifications to cryptography\n, trojan functionality, and anti-detection. The speed at which Cozy Bear develops and deploys its components is reminiscent of the toolset of Fancy Bear, which also uses the tools\nCHOPSTICK and CORESHELL.[9]\n\n","Cozy Bear's CozyDuke malware toolset is structurally and functionally similar to second stage components used in early Miniduke, Cosmicduke, and OnionDuke operations. A second stage module of the CozyDuke malware, Show.dll, appears to have been built onto the same platform as OnionDuke, suggesting that the authors are working together or are the same people.[9]\n\nThe campaigns and the malware toolsets they use are referred to as the Dukes, including Cosmicduke, Cozyduke, and Miniduke.[8]\n\nCozyDuke is connected to the MiniDuke and CosmicDuke campaigns, as well as to the OnionDuke cyberespionage campaign. Each threat group tracks their targets and use toolsets that were likely created and updated by Russian speakers.[1]\n\nFollowing exposure of the MiniDuke in 2013, updates to the malware were written in C\n/C++\nand it was packed with a new obfuscator\n.[7]\n\n","Cozy Bear is suspected of being behind the 'HAMMERTOSS' remote access tool\nwhich uses commonly visited websites like Twitter\nand GitHub\nto relay command data\n.[10]\n\n","Seaduke is a highly configurable, low-profile Trojan\nonly used for a small set of high-value targets. Typically, Seaduke is installed on systems already infected with the much more widely distributed CozyDuke.[8]\n\n","Evidence suggests that Cozy Bear's targets have included commercial entities and government organizations in Germany, Uzbekistan, South Korea and the USA, including the US State Department\nand the White House\nin 2014.[9]\n\n","In March 2014, a Washington, D.C.-based private research institute was found to have Cozyduke (Trojan.Cozer) on their network. Cozy Bear then started an email campaign attempting to lure victims into clicking on a flash video of office monkeys that would also include malicious executables.[8]\n\n[1]\n\nBy July the group had compromised government networks and directed Cozyduke-infected systems to install Miniduke onto a compromised network.[8]\n\n","In the summer of 2014, digital agents of the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service\ninfiltrated Cozy Bear. They found that these Russian hackers were targeting the US Democratic Party, State Department and White House. Their evidence influenced the FBI’s decision to open an investigation.[3]\n\n","In August 2015 Cozy Bear was linked to a spear-phishing\ncyber-attack\nagainst the Pentagon\nemail\nsystem causing the shut down of the entire Joint Staff unclassified email system and Internet access during the investigation.[11]\n\n[12]\n\n","In June 2016, Cozy Bear was implicated alongside the hacker group Fancy Bear\nin the Democratic National Committee cyber attacks\n.[2]\n\nWhile the two groups were both present in the Democratic National Committee\n's servers at the same time, they appeared to be unaware of the other, each independently stealing the same passwords and otherwise duplicating their efforts.[13]\n\nA CrowdStrike forensic team determined that while Cozy Bear had been on the DNC's network for over a year, Fancy Bear had only been there a few weeks.[14]\n\nCozy Bear's more sophisticated tradecraft and interest in traditional long-term espionage suggest that the group originates from a separate Russian intelligence agency.[13]\n\n","After the United States presidential election, 2016\n, Cozy Bear was linked to a series of coordinated and well-planned spear phishing campaigns against U.S.-based think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).[15]\n\n","On February 3, 2017, the Norwegian Police Security Service\n(PST) reported that attempts had been made to spearphish the email accounts of nine individuals in the Ministry of Defence\n, Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n, and the Labour Party\n. The acts were attributed to Cozy Bear, whose targets included the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority\n, PST section chief Arne Christian Haugstøyl, and an unnamed college. Prime Minister Erna Solberg\ncalled the acts \"a serious attack on our democratic institutions.\"[16]\n\nThe attacks were reportedly conducted in January 2017.[17]\n\n","On February 2017, it was revealed that Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear had made several attempts to hack into Dutch ministries, including the Ministry of General Affairs\n, over the previous six months. Rob Bertholee\n, head of the AIVD, said on EenVandaag\n\nthat the hackers were Russian and had tried to gain access to secret government documents.[18]\n\n","In a briefing to parliament, Dutch Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations Ronald Plasterk\nannounced that votes for the Dutch general election\nin March 2017 would be counted by hand.[19]\n\n"],"title":"Cozy Bear","rels":["/wiki/2016_United_States_election_interference_by_Russia","/wiki/The_Plot_to_Hack_America","/wiki/February_2010_Australian_cyberattacks","/wiki/Operation_Aurora","/wiki/Operation_Payback","/wiki/DigiNotar","/wiki/HBGary","/wiki/Operation_AntiSec","/wiki/Operation_Tunisia","/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage","/wiki/RSA_SecurID#March_2011_system_compromise","/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack","/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak","/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack","/wiki/Snapchat#December_2013_hack","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#August_2013_breach","/wiki/Anthem_medical_data_breach","/wiki/Operation_Tovar","/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos","/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack","/wiki/2014_Russian_hacker_password_theft","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach","/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach","/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach","/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach","/wiki/VTech#2015_data_breach","/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack","/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery","/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center#Ransomware","/wiki/Commission_on_Elections_data_breach","/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack","/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/2017_Westminster_cyberattack","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/2017_cyberattacks_on_Ukraine","/wiki/Equifax#May–July_2017_data_breach","/wiki/Deloitte#2016–17_email_hack","/wiki/Disqus#October_2017_security_breach","/wiki/Anonymous_(group)","/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous","/wiki/Bureau_121","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/CyberBerkut","/wiki/Derp_(hacker_group)","/wiki/Equation_Group","/wiki/Fancy_Bear","/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America","/wiki/Goatse_Security","/wiki/Guccifer_2.0","/wiki/Hacking_Team","/wiki/Iranian_Cyber_Army","/wiki/Lizard_Squad","/wiki/LulzRaft","/wiki/LulzSec","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack#Perpetrators","/wiki/NullCrew","/wiki/NSO_Group","/wiki/PayPal_14","/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398","/wiki/PLATINUM_(cybercrime_group)","/wiki/Pranknet","/wiki/RedHack","/wiki/Rocket_Kitten","/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers","/wiki/Syrian_Electronic_Army","/wiki/TeaMp0isoN","/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations","/wiki/UGNazi","/wiki/Yemen_Cyber_Army","/wiki/George_Hotz","/wiki/Guccifer","/wiki/Hector_Monsegur","/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond","/wiki/Junaid_Hussain","/wiki/Kristoffer_von_Hassel","/wiki/Mustafa_Al-Bassam","/wiki/MLT_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Ryan_Ackroyd","/wiki/Topiary_(hacktivist)","/wiki/The_Jester_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Weev","/wiki/Evercookie","/wiki/ISeeYou","/wiki/Heartbleed","/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)","/wiki/POODLE","/wiki/Rootpipe","/wiki/Row_hammer","/wiki/JASBUG","/wiki/Stagefright_(bug)","/wiki/DROWN_attack","/wiki/Badlock","/wiki/Dirty_COW","/wiki/Cloudbleed","/wiki/Broadcom#Vulnerabilities","/wiki/EternalBlue","/wiki/DoublePulsar","/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology#Silent_Bob_is_Silent","/wiki/KRACK","/wiki/ROCA_vulnerability","/wiki/BlueBorne_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Ransomware#Bad_Rabbit","/wiki/Careto_(malware)","/wiki/CryptoLocker","/wiki/Dexter_(malware)","/wiki/Duqu","/wiki/Duqu_2.0","/wiki/FinFisher","/wiki/Flame_(malware)","/wiki/Gameover_ZeuS","/wiki/Mahdi_(malware)","/wiki/Metulji_botnet","/wiki/Mirai_(malware)","/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog","/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club#Staatstrojaner_affair","/wiki/Shamoon","/wiki/Stars_virus","/wiki/Stuxnet","/wiki/Vault_7","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/X-Agent","/wiki/Cozy_Bear","/wiki/Cozy_Bear"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Cozy_Bear"}

However, they only crashed Phantoml0rd's game, while other games in DoTA 2 were running normally.","When PhantomL0rd asked members of the hacker group why they were attacking these sites, they responded by saying it was \"for the lulz\n\"[4]\n\nand that it was also partially out of dislike for \"money-hungry companies.\"[10]\n\nThey also persuaded PhantomL0rd into playing Club Penguin\n[2]\n\nwhile simultaneously managing to take down Electronic Arts\nwebsite EA.com.[9]\n\nPhantomL0rd's personal information was leaked during the attack and released onto multiple gaming websites, in a process often referred to as doxing\n.[7]\n\nThis led to many fake orders of pizza arriving at his house, as well as a police raid on his house when they received reports about a hostage situation.[3]\n\nAccording to PhantomL0rd, at least six policemen searched through his house,[5]\n\n[9]\n\nbut they only realized later that the call was fake.[11]\n\nThe hacker group claimed to have additionally attacked several other Internet games and websites including World of Tanks\n, the North Korean\nnews network KCNA\n, RuneScape\n, Eve Online\n, a Westboro Baptist Church\nwebsite, the website and online servers of Minecraft\n, and many others. A day after the attacks, Riot Games issued a statement confirming that their League of Legends services had indeed been attacked by the hacker group, though they have brought their services back online.[9]\n\n","The news website LatinoPost criticized the attack as being \"frivolous\" and merely \"just for attention,\" unlike so-called hacktivist\ngroups.[10]\n\nComputer scientist David Birti considered it fortunate at the time that their hacking activities have mainly been restricted to denial of service\nattacks and have not been as severe as password leakage yet.[7]\n\nVentureBeat\nnoted that PhantomL0rd's stream was still drawing in over one hundred thousand viewers and that it is \"still good for his traffic.\"[8]\n\nPlayStation LifeStyle\nstated that they believe the current problems with the PlayStation Network\nhad more to do with the \"influx of new PS4 owners and increased holiday online activity\" than any effect or damage the hacker group attempted on the network.[6]\n\nEditor of popular gaming news website Game Informer\n's Mike Futter also blamed the Twitch\nstreaming service and PhantomL0rd for not shutting the stream immediately despite having received several warnings throughout, and that this was tantamount to playing accomplices to the crime. Varga defended himself by saying that he was merely trying to maintain a business, and that if he did not comply, DerpTrolling would have targeted another streamer.[12]\n\n"],"title":"Derp (hacker group)","rels":["/wiki/Lizard_Squad","/wiki/Anonymous_(Group)","/wiki/February_2010_Australian_cyberattacks","/wiki/Operation_Aurora","/wiki/Operation_Payback","/wiki/DigiNotar","/wiki/HBGary","/wiki/Operation_AntiSec","/wiki/Operation_Tunisia","/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage","/wiki/RSA_SecurID#March_2011_system_compromise","/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack","/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak","/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack","/wiki/Snapchat#December_2013_hack","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#August_2013_breach","/wiki/Anthem_medical_data_breach","/wiki/Operation_Tovar","/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos","/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack","/wiki/2014_Russian_hacker_password_theft","/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach","/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach","/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach","/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach","/wiki/VTech#2015_data_breach","/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack","/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery","/wiki/Hollywood_Presbyterian_Medical_Center#Ransomware","/wiki/Commission_on_Elections_data_breach","/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee_cyber_attacks","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack","/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/2017_Westminster_cyberattack","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/2017_cyberattacks_on_Ukraine","/wiki/Equifax#May–July_2017_data_breach","/wiki/Deloitte#2016–17_email_hack","/wiki/Disqus#October_2017_security_breach","/wiki/Anonymous_(group)","/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous","/wiki/Bureau_121","/wiki/Cozy_Bear","/wiki/CyberBerkut","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Equation_Group","/wiki/Fancy_Bear","/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America","/wiki/Goatse_Security","/wiki/Guccifer_2.0","/wiki/Hacking_Team","/wiki/Iranian_Cyber_Army","/wiki/Lizard_Squad","/wiki/LulzRaft","/wiki/LulzSec","/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack#Perpetrators","/wiki/NullCrew","/wiki/NSO_Group","/wiki/PayPal_14","/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398","/wiki/PLATINUM_(cybercrime_group)","/wiki/Pranknet","/wiki/RedHack","/wiki/Rocket_Kitten","/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers","/wiki/Syrian_Electronic_Army","/wiki/TeaMp0isoN","/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations","/wiki/UGNazi","/wiki/Yemen_Cyber_Army","/wiki/George_Hotz","/wiki/Guccifer","/wiki/Hector_Monsegur","/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond","/wiki/Junaid_Hussain","/wiki/Kristoffer_von_Hassel","/wiki/Mustafa_Al-Bassam","/wiki/MLT_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Ryan_Ackroyd","/wiki/Topiary_(hacktivist)","/wiki/The_Jester_(hacktivist)","/wiki/Weev","/wiki/Evercookie","/wiki/ISeeYou","/wiki/Heartbleed","/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)","/wiki/POODLE","/wiki/Rootpipe","/wiki/Row_hammer","/wiki/JASBUG","/wiki/Stagefright_(bug)","/wiki/DROWN_attack","/wiki/Badlock","/wiki/Dirty_COW","/wiki/Cloudbleed","/wiki/Broadcom#Vulnerabilities","/wiki/EternalBlue","/wiki/DoublePulsar","/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology#Silent_Bob_is_Silent","/wiki/KRACK","/wiki/ROCA_vulnerability","/wiki/BlueBorne_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)","/wiki/Ransomware#Bad_Rabbit","/wiki/Careto_(malware)","/wiki/CryptoLocker","/wiki/Dexter_(malware)","/wiki/Duqu","/wiki/Duqu_2.0","/wiki/FinFisher","/wiki/Flame_(malware)","/wiki/Gameover_ZeuS","/wiki/Mahdi_(malware)","/wiki/Metulji_botnet","/wiki/Mirai_(malware)","/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog","/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)","/wiki/Petya_(malware)","/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club#Staatstrojaner_affair","/wiki/Shamoon","/wiki/Stars_virus","/wiki/Stuxnet","/wiki/Vault_7","/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack","/wiki/X-Agent","/wiki/Derp_(hacker_group)","/wiki/Derp_(hacker_group)"]},"downloaded":true,"title":"/wiki/Derp_(hacker_group)"}
